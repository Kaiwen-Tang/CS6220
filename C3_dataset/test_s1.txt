4 The discussion is far from over. The true mind of science remains open to new data and alternative explanations. Whether and how much of the approximately 1/2 degree C of warming which occurred in the latter half of the 20th century is due to human industry has not been conclusively established. Neither have any of the incredibly expensive "solutions" proposed to address any global warming been shown to be meaningfully effective or worth their tremendous cost.
1 Nuccitellis answer to this unexceptionable and temperately-expressed statement is that sea level rises chiefly through thermal expansion and melting land ice, so it is all our fault. However, it ought to have been obvious even to Nuccitelli thermal expansion and land-ice melt happen whether Man or nature is the cause.
1 It makes you wonder what created all that CO2 millions of years ago.
0 People concerned that manmade greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), may be causing dangerous climate change worry such a change may disrupt the hydrosphere, which comprises all of the water on Earth and in its atmosphere. This disruption, they argue, would lead to increased rainfall and erratic weather patterns that would greatly increase sea level and produce potentially devastating consequences.A report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an independent group of some 50 scientists from 15 countries, titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, summarizes a large body of research disputing these claims and finds the hydrosphere has exhibited only mild volatility over the past century in concert with natural climate cycles and with no correlation to human CO2 emissions.The data show short-term precipitation volatility is not correlated with either CO2 emissions or general climate warming. For example, monsoon intensity displayed no increase later in the century despite increased CO2 emissions, but instead was correlated with solar activity.In addition, monsoons were generally more intensive during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which runs directly contrary to the alarmist claims. On the other end of the volatility spectrum, CCR-II disputes the strength of the commonly cited connection between global warming and droughts, as evidenced by the similar rates of drought occurrence in the LIA and MWP.As with precipitation, CCR-II finds no significant connection between sea level or ocean temperature and human CO2 emissions. Sea level is determined by a multitude of factors, and CO2-induced global warming is a minor one. Ocean temperatures have remained virtually unchanged for nine years, according to data of the Argo buoy network.CCR-II found numerous problems with the consensus view of sea-level change. The global sea level has increased by an average of only 12 mm annually over the century, with a wide range of intra-year volatility between +5mm and -5mm away from the mean. Supposed instances of environmental harm caused by sea-level rises, such as coral reef destruction, are often the result of unaccounted alternative factors.Concern over manmade greenhouse gas emissions has been the impetus for many destructive public policies, including renewable portfolio standards, alternative energy subsidies, and high gasoline taxes. Yet, despite ever-increasing levels of CO2 emissions, scientists have been unable to demonstrate a connection to its alleged effects, such as hydrosphere alteration, over the previous century. CCR-II's findings demonstrate precipitation and ocean activity have little to no connection to human CO2 emissions. Therefore, energy production, the lifeblood of the global economy, should not be hindered by state intervention to reduce CO2 emissions.The above introduction was based on text from Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science and its Summary for Policymakers, published by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).The following documents provide additional information about the hydrosphere and oceans. Chapter 6 of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Chapter-6-Hydrosphere-Oceans.pdfIn Chapter Six of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, Willem de Lange and Robert M. Carter find little evidence for an overall increase in global precipitation during the twentieth century independent of natural multidecadal climate rhythms. Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdfThe IPCC claims to know, apparently with rising certainty over time, that "most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations" (IPCC AR4 SPM, p. 10). This Summary for Policymakers summarizes and interprets Climate Change Reconsidered II, a major scientific report that refutes this claim. More IPCC Misdirection: Its Dodgy Sea Level-Rise Assessmenthttp://www.cato.org/blog/more-ipcc-misdirection-its-dodgy-sea-level-rise-assessmentPatrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger of the Cato Institute criticize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's analysis of sea-level changes in a September 24, 2013 blog post. The authors point out the IPCC cherry-picks data clumps that coincide with their conclusions, while ignoring broader data that contradict them. For instance, the IPCC attributes the recent abnormally high increases in sea level to a new long-term trend, even though the rate of increase has already begun to decline to normal levels, thereby indicating this period was just another short-term cyclical increase. Precipitation Measurements and Trends in the Twentieth Century http://heartland.org/policy-documents/precipitation-measurements-and-trends-twentieth-centuryA research paper published in the International Journal of Climatology in 2002 presents the trends in precipitation over the last century. Global precipitation increased by only 9 mm per year over the century, despite enormous short-term volatility of up to 40mm. Short-term variability can be attributed to natural climate cycles, including reoccurring ENSOs, Arctic Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation. The authors admit global precipitation measurement is still primitive and not wholly reliable. Little Change in Global Drought Over the Past 60 Yearshttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/little-change-global-drought-over-past-60-yearsIn this paper published in 2012 in Nature, Justin Sheffield, Eric F. Wood, and Michael L. Roderick cast doubt on the supposed connection between global warming and the frequency of droughts over the past 60 years. The standard analysis used to estimate global moisture levels is highly flawed and underestimates moisture levels, they note. In reality, global moisture levels have barely changed, and by extension, theories that blame hydrosphere changes on global warming are also flawed. Research Explores Hidden Benefits of Intensive Rainfall in East Africahttp://phys.org/news/2012-11-explores-hidden-benefits-intensive-rainfall.htmlMaggie Clune looks at a new study published in 2012 in Nature Climate Change, which demonstrates some benefits of increased rainfall. Generally, climate scientists tend to focus on only the negative effects of climate change while ignoring the positive results it produces. One of these is that increased rainfall replenishes freshwater sources more often. This makes underwater aquifers, rivers, streams, etc. more bountiful, especially in technologically less-developed regions that are heavily dependent upon natural water sources, such as Central Africa. Indian Monsoon Variability in a Global Warming Scenariohttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/indian-monsoon-variability-global-warming-scenarioA paper published in 2003 in Natural Hazards applies to real historical data the IPCC's theory that global warming increases monsoon intensity. The researchers determined there is no correlation between monsoon intensity and global warming. Monsoon strength naturally oscillates along decade-long time intervals regardless of carbon production. Furthermore, increased global temperatures have no effect on intra-cycle variability.

2 The most impressive thing about this summer's vaunted droughtcalled an "ultra-drought" by CBS icon Dan Ratheris that it wasn't one. Whereas Rather called this a "summer to survive" in the Midwest, it actually looked more like a summer to grow.Illinois experienced what is at least its third-wettest June (records go back to 1895). Toward the end of June, the entire state of Illinois, 90 percent of Missouri and Wisconsin, and half of Iowa were reporting unusually moist conditions. We think that qualifies as the "Midwest."But why should we be surprised by this spate of climate hyperbole? That kind of drought hype is about as repetitive as Vice President Al Gore saying "risky." Last summer, for example, we were bombarded with the same story, even though less of the country than normal was experiencing a significant moisture shortage. Both the ostensible drought and forecasts of more of the same were based upon the appearance of La Nia (unusually cold) conditions in the tropical Pacific.Going back just another year, recall the agricultural disasters predicted because of El Nio, the warm phase of this common Pacific oscillation. One major network featured brown cornstalks and a cloud of dust in August. That was in Texas, where corn is normally brown in August, given that it's planted early in the year. As for the dust, it was kicked up by a harvester plucking fat ears.The beating goes on and on. And what we find most interesting is that people continue to eat. Well and cheaply, we might add. What gives?Let's stipulate that supply and demand determine price. For food, the latter is increasing because there is a larger number of demanding mouths to feed. Everything else being equal, the price of food should increase slightly as a result of that. But adding in the effect of the 2000 drought, the 1999 drought, the 1998 drought, and so forth should be as calamitous as the Network News.In an attempt to verify all these terrible stories, we plotted out the price of corn in dollars per bushel, allowing for inflation. What is immediately obvious is that the price of corn is lower than it has ever been. Despite all the weather gloom and doom, as well as the population increase, the relative supply of the most important crop produced by the most important agricultural nation in history must be increasing.Our greener pals keep blaming us for the fact that Americans just don't seem to care about global warming. But perhaps they ought to look in the mirror. Constantly hawking weather disasters has a way of losing its credibility in the face of agricultural abundance.It is absurd to conflate warming with food shortages. The corn yield history was virtually steady for the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a dramatic rise in the second half. Today, one acre of land produces almost four times as much corn as it did 100 years ago.During that same time, U.S. temperatures varied considerably from year to year and decade to decade. Obviously, there is little if any correspondence between the nation's temperatures and its crop yields.What warming the United States has seen in the last three decades has been primarily in winter and, within that season, largely confined to the coldest air massesa prediction from greenhouse theory that the climate Cassandras rarely tout. A temperature change of this sort is beneficial for crops because it lengthens their growing season.Another benefit for crop production is the ever-increasing atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. We can certainly assert with confidence that the presence of additional carbon dioxide is responsible for about 10 percent of this abundant harvest.The evidence is in. Today's climate is a boon to agricultureno matter what you may hear on the evening news.ReferencesMichaels, P.J., et al., 2000. Observed warming in cold anticyclones.

3 The Kyoto Protocol, even if implemented by all industrialized countries, including the United States, would only barely slow the increase in GHG concentrations.Actually reducing GHG concentrations below todays levels (~385 ppm) may well exceed human capability in this century. Even outright de-industrialization of the United States might not be enough to lower GHG levels, since most emissions growth in the 21st century is projected to occur in developing countries .

4 British economist Sir Nicholas Stern recently made international headlines with a report claiming the debate is over on climate change and predicting dire economic effects. But on the heels of that report came a scathing article in London's Sunday Telegraph by renowned journalist Christopher Monckton that debunks this so-called scientific consensus. He notes that the United Nation's main report on global warming purposely censored data about a Medieval Warm Period that saw global temperatures 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now. He further states that the famous hockey stick graph, which allegedly shows a major recent spike, has been thoroughly discredited. Apparently, there's little harmony in Britain over this continuing controversy.

3 The Golden State already has some expensive GHG reduction requirements. For example, the California Air Resources Board predicts its carbon dioxide limits for new automobiles will add $1,000 to the cost of a car. Californians must get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2017, raising the costs of power production. If approved, the Governor's "million solar roofs" program will stick the state's electricity ratepayers with a surcharge to subsidize solar electricity systems.
4 Unfortunately, the article is just the latest in a very long line of examples of ABCs climate groupthink, where the utterances of climate scientists are beyond reproach and questioning of the consensus is frowned upon.That is not how science works: the motto, which the ABC, our taxpayer-funded and supposedly impartial national broadcaster, would do well to remember, is question everything.
0 Mr. Lazear has fallen for the greatest lie ever; the assertion that greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are warming the Earth. The hoaxers are calling the past seventeen years "a pause" in warming, but it is actually an indicator that the Earth is on the cusp of the next ice age. The period in between ice ages is calculated at 11,500 years and we are at the end of the current interglacial period.
4 Yes, as Climate Hustle makes clear, there are dissenting scientistsbut they are marginalized, even called "kooks."

0 During Boston's record-breaking snowfall this past winter, officials used large empty parking lots that were devoted for one thing: snow piles. Officials called them "snow farms" and they rose to heights unseen in modern history. And now, in the sweltering heat of summer, one is still sitting in South Boston , dripping away and revealing a vast wasteland of trash underneath. When WBZ (CBS News) Boston went to check on the man-made glacier, what they found in that still-melting pile of snow was a bit of a shocker: a baby stroller, lottery tickets, part of a bicycle, laundry baskets, hubcaps, and more.

4 Here is a formidable source of data on climate change, courtesy of prof. Lindzen (MIT) from a CEI presentation a couple of weeks ago. Once more, he reminds us that many statements bandied about and accepted as gospel truths are in fact serious distortions and sometimes outright contrary even to authorities such as the IPCC.
4 Given the myriad scientific holes in the manmade global warming hypothesis and allowing for the inevitable future discoveries about climate, it seems quite absurd for Congress to proceed on global warming as if, in Al Gore's words, "There is no longer any serious debate over the basic points that make up the consensus on global warming."
4 In response, CEI filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking documents related to the video, its production at taxpayer expense, and OSTP's rejection of its correction request. Despite having earlier claimed that the video was just Holdren's personal opinion, not the agency's, OSTP withheld portions of emails about it as privileged "agency records." It also refused to produce drafts of its letter rejecting CEI's request for correction. It withheld two drafts even though they had been shared with an outside professor (and initially even concealed their very existence), even though sharing a document with someone outside an agency usually waives any privilege to keep it secret.
4 Steve McIntyre?s latest post at Climate Audit includes the extraordinary revelation that Michael Mann?s latest submission to the courts regarding his libel suit includes a doctored quote. The offending words purport to be an excerpt from the Russell inquiry report, but, demonstrating a startling disregard for the court, the excerpt has been altered to make it look as if Mann had been exonerated by Russell. However, this has been done so badly as to make the alteration fairly obvious.
1 Now, the average of this system, the whole atmosphere and surface included together, is what should have the global average temperature of -18 degrees C, and it does, because the temperature goes from warm (+15 degrees C) at the bottom of the atmosphere, to cold (-70 degrees C) at the top of the atmosphere, and measured from space it is -18 degrees C on average. The bottom of the atmosphere is warmest because that is where the Sun does the real-time physical heating in the first place. The temperature decreases with altitude because the heat dissipates outwards from the ground and cools down, and also because of the natural adiabatic gradient. The amount of water vapour in the air-column reduces the adiabatic gradient and it also reduces night-time cooling, because of latent heat which is trapped and then released by the H2O molecules. -And to be sure, those H2O molecules wouldnt be able to get into the air-column if sunshine was freezing cold at -18 degrees C!- Finally, the natural existence of the adiabatic gradient (that is, the fact that the air has to cool with altitude), means that the bottom of the atmosphere must be warmer than top and therefore the bottom must also be warmer than the average. If the average has to be -18 degrees C, then this average has to be found between the bottom (warmest) and the top (coldest), and the bottom will naturally be warmer than that average. Its all totally sensible when you do the physics correctly, and no greenhouse effect is needed to be invented.
4 Between 2000 and 2005, drought conditions (combined with greatly increased water usage in Arizona, California, Nevada and Colorado) caused Lake Powell levels to drop nearly 120 feet. This prompted a considerable consensus of global warming hysteria.
3 It should also be noted that, if the Carbon Plans are followed through, demand for electricity will increase as transport and domestic heating are decarbonised. The Committee on Climate Change have estimated that demand could increase by 30% by 2030 as a result. This would push peak demand up to 80GW. With an appropriate safety margin, we would then be looking at, say, 90GW.

4 Reality may be a bit simpler, or much more complicated. But the reason this is all so important is that if there is no good explanation for the lack of warming, then an increasingly viable alternative is that we have overestimated the gross sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide in our computer models.
4 The environmental movement has become a cesspool of hate, where hack journalists and bureaucrats can openly fantasize about violently punishing their political adversaries, and where scientists compromised by a poisonous ideology lie and steal to discredit their intellectual opponents.

3 Let's review. The Obama administration is perpetuating a pernicious legal double standard with regard to federal wildlife laws. It prosecutes industries that produce "dirty" energy and exempts those that claim to produce "clean" energy. Furthermore, it's giving the wind industry a get-out-of-jail-free card so that if it kills some of our most-endangered species, such as the California condor, it will not face prosecution. The wind industry is further expanding its operations onto public land in both California and Wyoming. And the American Wind Energy Association has recently said that its main goal is to obtain a multi-year extension of the production tax credit, the lucrative subsidy that was extended for one year back in January. In other words, despite some two decades of subsidies, the wind lobby claims it still needs public money to be viable.
4 The most precise records of global temperature began in 1979, when continuous satellite observations started recording temperatures at different heights in the atmosphere. The globally averaged temperatures, derived from the satellites and balloons, of the layer of the atmosphere from the surface to a height of a few kilometers do not show the increasing warming trend over the last twenty years expected by the computer model projections of the effects of added CO2 in the air (see Figure 2).
4 Fresh doubt has been cast on evidence for global warming following the discovery that a key method of measuring temperature change has exaggerated the warming rate by almost 40 percent. Studies of temperature records dating back more than a century have seemed to indicate a rise in global temperature of around 0.5C, with much of it occurring since the late 1970s. This has led many scientists to conclude global warming is under way, with the finger of blame usually pointed at man-made emissions of such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide.Now an international team of scientists, including researchers from the Met Office in Bracknell, Berkshire, United Kingdom, has found serious discrepancies in the temperature measurements, suggesting that the amount of global warming is much less than previously believed.Measuring water, not airThe concern focuses on the temperature of the atmosphere over the oceans, which cover almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface. While scientists use standard weather station instruments to detect warming on land, they have been forced to rely on the crews of ships to make measurements over the vast ocean regions.Crews have taken the temperature by dipping buckets into the sea or using water flowing into the engine intakes. Scientists have assumed there is a simple link between the temperature of seawater and that of the air above it.However, after analyzing years of data from scientific buoys in the Pacific that measure sea and air temperatures simultaneously, the team has found no evidence of a simple link. Instead, the seawater measurements have exaggerated the amount of global warming over the seas, with the real temperature having risen less than half as fast during the 1970s than the standard measurements suggest.Reporting their findings in the influential journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists say the exact cause of the discrepancy is not known. One possibility is that the atmosphere responded faster than the sea to cooling events such as volcanic eruptions.A big cutThe findings have major implications for the climate change debate because sea temperature measurements are a key part of global warming calculations. According to the team, replacing the standard seawater data with the appropriate air data produces a big cut in the overall global warming rate during the last 20 years, from around 0.18C per decade to 0.13C.This suggests that the widely quoted global warming figure used to persuade governments to take action on greenhouse gas emissions exaggerates the true warming rate by almost 40 percent. The team is now calling for climate experts to switch from seawater data to sea-air temperature measurements.One member of the team, David Parker, of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the Met Office, said the discovery of the discrepancy "shows we don't understand everything, and that we need better observations--all branches of science are like that." Yet according to Parker, the new results do not undermine the case for global warming: "It is raising questions about the interpretation of the sea-surface data."Even so, the findings will be seized on by skeptics as more evidence that scientists have little idea about the current rate of global warming, let alone its future rate. Climate experts are still trying to explain why satellites measuring the temperature of the Earth have detected little sign of global warming, despite taking measurements during supposedly the warmest period on record.Some researchers suspect the fault may again lie with the ground-based temperature measurements. They say many of the data come from stations surrounded by growing urban sprawl, whose warmth could give a misleading figure. A study of data taken around Vienna, Austria, between 1951 and 1996 found that the air temperature rose by anything from zero to 0.6C, depending on precisely where the measurements were made.Robert Matthews is a staff reporter for the UK Telegraph, with whose permission this article is reprinted.

4 In principle these cycles are sinusoidal in behavior as depicted in Figure 1. Bob Tisdale has also shown how the temperature increase of the 65-year cycle from 1975 to 1998 led to the assumption that it is due CO2 emissions because they too happened to be parallel. This has been naively extended all the way to the year 2100 and forms the basis for the climate models and the invention of the so-called climate catastrophe.

4 The presenters on the panel were generally scathing about the quality of the IPCC's assessment reports in their fields of expertise. For instance, Prof. Reiter revealed that, the nine lead authors of the chapter discussing vector-borne diseases in the Second Assessment Report had published a total of six papers on the subject. The three leading critics of the chapter, including Prof. Reiter, had published over 550 scholarly papers. Prof. Morner has written in a peer-reviewed journal article that the IPCC chapter on sea-level rise represents "a low and unacceptable standard. It should be totally rewritten by a totally new group of authors chosen among the group of true sea-level specialists."
0 Now heres where the proponents of manmade global warming get goofy. In very basic terms: some climate scientists point to the cooling temperature in the eastern tropical Pacific and say global surface temperatures should also cool because the El Nio is done where they have their El Nio-measuring thermometers. Those scientists know theres a huge amount of warm water left over after a strong El Nio; they know the leftover warm water has been redistributed to other parts of the global oceans away from their El Nio-measuring thermometers; yet they have the gall of conmen when they to point to those El Nio-measuring thermometers in the eastern tropical Pacific and tell us the effects of the El Nio are done. They then heap it on thicker when they say, since surface temperatures have warmed away from their El Nio-measuring thermometers, the warming elsewhere must be caused by manmade greenhouse gases. They have presented that absurd argument in a good number of scientific papers. They know it makes no sense, I know it and now you know it.
3 Left unsaid is that carbon emissions, as far as the climate is concerned, play a very minor role. Moreover, all those investments have been forced on the coal power industry by ever increasing levels of regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency. The cost is passed along to electricity consumersall of usas a necessary increase.
3 The U.S. could possibly even reduce its imports of fossil fuels by increasing domestic energy production, a political objective of both Democrats and Republicans. At the very least, the U.S. should be able to slow down the growth of fossil fuel imports, which contributes to its trade deficit. The extent to which the U.S. can reduce its oil imports will also depend on building nuclear power plants that can replace oil and coal generators that account for nearly 75% of U.S. electrical power.
4 The Earth system is not analogous to a house being heated with a furnace running at -18 degrees C, which temperature then gets amplified to +15 degrees C by insulation or backradiation or heat trapping. In fact, your furnace in your house doesnt even work like this. In fact, nothing anywhere works like this because it is a violation of thermodynamics. The greenhouse effect models have to violate thermodynamics because the people creating them never go back to think about whether they are conserving energy vs. flux, and whether or not they are conserving physics. These details havent apparently appealed to them.
3 Those nations will certainly insist on reductions from the developed world as part of the price of any reductions in greenhouse gas emissions they agree to. If we?ve already unilaterally cut our emissions in advance of an agreement, we will have to make even more painful cuts to persuade developing countries to sign on. Finally, this particular Congress is going to be unable to reach agreement on any major legislation before the 2014 elections.

3 The organizations are justifying their action because they care more about climate change than the environment. But the effectiveness of this project in making a meaningful dent in US greenhouse gas emissions is far from certain. The plant will provide peak power for just 140,000 users. Taxpayers are subsidizing up to 80 percent of the costs for the $2 billion project, according to the LA Times, and energy bills are still going to go up 50 percent if they use it.
3 Another continuing measure to reduce emissions is high gasoline taxes. Taxes have been increased to exorbitant levels in most western European nations, so that the typical price of gasoline is now over $7 per gallon. Yet emissions from the transportation sector have increased 26% since 1990, according to the European Environment Agency. It should be noted that each one dollar of tax per gallon of gas translates into a tax of approximately $100 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions.
3 The poorest and most underprivileged people in the world would benefit most from coal furnaces, natural gas plants, and other modern resources that our carbon-based economy and infrastructure help generate.
1 Still, taken together, the data reveals a consistent and convincing picture of near-zero warming trends in the tropical troposphere i.e., absence of an observed "hot spot". Coupled with a modeled trend "amplification"' of about 2, this suggests an extremely low value for the land surface trend hence low values of climate sensitivity to increases in CO2.

3 The problem is one of time and energy density: while nature spent millions of years concentrating solar energy in the forms of peat, coal, oil, and natural gas, all of the biofuels rely on sunlight to grow crops. Because such energy is extremely diffuse, the scale of land consumption and the labor required to gather massive quantities of low-density fuel quickly leads to diminishing returns.

The lack of critical thinking is reminiscent of the Johnson administrations repeated commitments of ground troops into Vietnam, without a well thought-out strategic plan. See Article # 2, links under The Administrations New Plan Push-Back, and Alternative, Green (Clean) Solar and Wind.
3 Developing America's vast domestic oil, natural gas, coal, shale gas and uranium deposits will generate millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in critically needed royalty and tax revenue. We must ensure that our energy policies generate revenues and create jobs instead of requiring constant taxpayer subsidies and destroying two to four traditional jobs for every "green" job that government "creates."
4 Its Pontifical Academy of Sciences recently held a workshop on climate change and sustainability . But only religious leaders, scientists, bureaucrats and regulators who support alarmist perspectives on these issues were invited. Those with contrary views were neither invited, welcomed nor tolerated.
3 America is the land of opportunity. With the abundance of resources beneath U.S. soil, the land is literally an opportunity. America has an abundance of natural resources, including sufficient energy reserves to provide Americans with affordable, reliable energy for several centuries. With its plentiful reserves of coal, natural gas, uranium, and oil, the United States is already a global leader in energy production. Regrettably, the federal government prohibits resource development in many parts of the country and off its coasts. Opening access begins with providing the opportunity for companies to develop America's resources, whether conventional sources of energy, minerals, or wind or solar power.
4 And what about the Arctic sea ice predictions? You have to laugh at the authors' shamelessness in picking Arctic sea ice here. Look, it's worse than we thought! Nevertheless, Stroeve et al 2007 proves an interesting read, with computer model simulations presented alongside observational data going back to 1950. The early figures in this dataset were apparently based on a paper from the Met Office, a read of which reveals that they were based on interpolation from other data points. The paper also contains these words of caution:
4 Has the globe warmed? Most think that since the late 19th century, there has been some warming. The issue becomes muddled when you consider such factors as the reliability of the data sets, the selective use of the proxy data used to estimate historic temperatures and the way urbanization warms local weather stations.
3 Recently, about one-third of America?s huge corn crop has been diverted from food and feed into an ultra-costly auto fuel that gives consumers poorer mileage even as it drives up their food costs. The corn ethanol diversion creates an artificial scarcity of farmland, as it attracts more land into corn instead of wheat or other crops?and the price effects are felt globally. In 2008, the ethanol mandate drove food prices up by more than 50 percent worldwide, and triggered food riots in Mexico and several other countries.
4 Climate change is a real phenomenon, but the catastrophic scenario of Gore and his fellow climate campaigners is steadily fraying around the edges if you follow the scientific literature closely.
3 As the clean energy scam collapses around the world, our Great Leader plans a comeback.
4 Just because a bunch of noisy, self-interested academics and politicians say that we're destroying the world does not mean that we should give up everything that modern technology has given us without abundant proof. For years now, Al Gore has been pointing to his fellow Nobel-prize winners, the IPC, as the last word in scientific proof. Today those selfsame "authorities" stand revealed instead as charlatans of no more scientific standing than Doctor Cure-all and his Magic Elixir.
3 Climate chaos is likewise the foundation for endless, punitive government policies and regulations intended to keep oil, gas and coal "in the ground." Crony politicians pass laws and unelected bureaucrats impose rules that transfer taxpayer and consumer wealth, decide which companies, industries and workers win or lose, and control people's lives, livelihoods, liberties and living standards.

0 Let's begin with the facts: During the past three decades, storms have become more destructive throughout Florida for one simple reason -- the state's population has grown. Indeed, it has tripled over 40 years. As people have moved near the coast they have both built in harm's way and destroyed the coastal wetlands that provide a natural buffer against hurricane-caused storm surge.
4 In describing the differences between their work and Mann's, Chapman et al. use surprisingly strong language for a scientific paper. They describe three of Mann's conclusions as "misleading," and his end-point analysis as "erroneous" and "just bad science."
4 As a contributor to the IPCC's 2007 report, I share the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. Yet I and many of my peers in the British House of Lords - through our hereditary element the most independent-minded of lawmakers - profoundly disagree on fundamental scientific grounds with both the IPCC and my co-laureate's alarmist movie An Inconvenient Truth, which won this year's Oscar for Best Sci-Fi Comedy Horror.
4 Newest Research Proves IPCC Climate Models Wrong: Global Warming Does Not Cause Increased Disaster Losses
4 The CFC ban was a perfect pilot for the anthropogenic global warming fraud. It established all the characters: the eco-left NGOs, the environmental "scientists" (both real and self-proclaimed), and big industry poised to make huge profits and political control over human choices and behavior. It had buy-ins by governments all over the planet. It was based on an unproven (and probably unprovable) hypothesis. Many industries stood to gain at the expense of consumers. To this day, research continues to be funded to study CFCs in the atmosphere. Most significantly, the "ozone hole" hasn't changed appreciably. It remains stable as if we ever really knew what "stable" was.

3 About $90 billion of those taxpayer funded giveaways went to green energy, which is about as trendy a cause as there is right now. Today, on the thirtieth of June, almost a year and half after the stimulus passed, the Department of Energy has awarded a scant 15% of its green energy stimulus funds. So much for timely.
3 With Southern Europe-Greece, Italy, Spain--facing economic collapse, and unemployment persistently high in America, there is no appetite for another costly round of greenhouse gas reductions at the UN climate change conference in Durban. For those concerned about global warming and climate change, it's time to look at simpler solutions provided by geoengineering.

4 But heres the problem. As Fig. 1 shows, until World War II, Anchorage was a very sleepy village of a few thousand. Since then the population has skyrocketed. But the homogeneity adjustment does not match this in any sense. The homogeneity adjustment is a straight line (albeit one with steps ...why steps? ... but I digress). The adjustment starts way back in 1926 ... why would the 1926 Anchorage temperature need any adjustment at all? And how does this adjust for UHI?
3 The small-business protections proposed in the Tailoring Rule are temporary, legally dubious, and incomplete. Even if courts uphold the Tailoring Rule, despite its flouting of clear statutory language, it will not avert the most absurd result of the Court's misreading of the CAA: regulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program.
3 America is a fracking cornucopia of crude oil, independent of the rapacious OPEC cartel. And has an inexhaustible supply of natural gas, putting us in a position to become a major exporter able to use its gas reserves as a geopolitical weapon. Take that, King Abdullah and Vladimir Putin. Too good to be true? You bet.
4 Muller was never a sceptic, and there are plenty of rusted on believers who have problems with both Manns hockey stick and AIT , which is nothing more than a propaganda film. Mullers subsequent evidence-free claim of attribution to human causes has led to widespread ridicule from within the warmist community.
4 The analysis relies totally on the accuracy of path width and length data. While this may now be reasonably accurate, past data is highly suspect.
3 Subsidies are extremely generous and guarantee investors an almost 10 per cent annual return for 20 years. Given such an unparalleled offer, it is not surprising that more than a million families already have installed solar panels. This solar boom, however, has saddled the country with obligations of more than ?130bn in subsidies, leading to ever increasing energy prices.
4 Genuine scientific inquiry has brought us the wonders of modern medicine, the green revolution in agriculture, the internet, and countless enhancements of the human condition in all its aspects. We can't allow the global warmerstruly the flat-earthers of the late 20th centuryto steal that precious inheritance. Scientists and researchers really dedicated to their mission should rise up in protest against global warming hysteria, saving science from the dead hand of politics and restoring it to its proper place in the pantheon of human achievement.

1 But here comes our favorite set of conclusions. Mackay writes Diatom census data and reconstructions of snow accumulation suggest that changes in the influence of the Siberian High in the Lake Baikal region started as early as c. 1750 AD, with a shift from taxa that bloom during autumn overturn to assemblages that exhibit net growth in spring (after ice break-up). The data here mirror instrumental climate records from Fennoscandia for example, which also show over the last 250 years positive temperature trends and increasing early summer Siberian temperature reconstructions. Warming in the Lake Baikal region commenced before rapid increases in greenhouse gases, and at least initially, is therefore a response to other forcing factors such as insolation changes during this period of the most recent millennial cycle.
3 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, global warming was the Left's last, best chance to redistribute wealth for a supposedly greater cause. When global warming, too, collapses, will they go gently into that good night?
4 John Christy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville, who with his colleague Roy Spencer compiles the satellite temperature record, commented that Santer's "model shows that increasing tropopause heights are due in good measure to human factors for 1979-99. However, the real world shows a huge tropospheric temperature spike due to the 1997-98 El Nino which then tilts the tropopause height trend upward. So what causes the height increase in the model and in the data are likely two different causes."

3 The people of the United States need to understand that the production of fossil fuels is a manufacturing process. Production of 1,000 tons of coal, 330 barrels of oil, or 6 million cubic feet of natural gas is the same as producing a $30,000 car, 7,000 bushels of corn, or 15,000 two-dollar hamburgers. Millions of high paying jobs are created, billions of tax and royalty payments are paid, and security and safety will increase for all our citizens.
4 Ladies & Gentleman, mankind is in danger. The threat is real. Unless we, gathered here together resolve to take action there will be real and dire consequences. Never before in my lifetime has the danger been so real, so close, so palpable. The threat, however, is not from man-made global warming, but from man-made hysteria. Yesterday, some 10,000 delegates representing over 180 nations flew into this lovely city for the start of the United Nations conference on Climate Change. They represent the greatest threat to the health, safety, and standard of living for all mankind since the fall of twentienth century totalitarianism.

4 I would like to contact Dr. Scheckman directly. His characterization of Drs. Happer and Chou is hardly accurate. My last collaboration with Dr. Chou was over 7 years ago, and he has had no connection with the present research. Dr. Happer, although not a climate scientist (as, for example, is also the case with Anderson), is deeply involved in general spectroscopic issues. Four of the suggested reviewers are well known proponents of global warming alarm, and I don?t think it likely that they would provide a fair assessment. An alternative reviewer with a long and neutral record in this field is Albert Arking (of Johns Hopkins) who would be far more suitable. Of those mentioned by Scheckman, Ramanathan is the most likely to be fair.
3 A major part of the expansion into wind will be at offshore sites that are comparatively costly to build and maintain, compared with onshore sites and many other energy sources.
4 What further complicates the situation, is that scientists like all people, come to opposing conclusions. In the case of politics, choosing the right scientists affects the outcome far more than actually committing fraud. Fraud is not the keystone of a good conspiracy, subtleties of choice are.
4 Moreover, an average global temperature can only be diagnosed; it cannot be directly measured. The approach has been to sample air temperatures across the globe in order to construct a global average surface temperature trend. However, there is a major problem with the use of the sampling of surface air temperature trends as is discussed below, for example, for nighttime minimum temperatures over land (which are used as part of the construction of the global average trend).

1 The scientists found the years from 800 to 1300, known as the Medieval Warm Period, had the most frequent fires in the 3,000 years studied. Other research has found that the period from 800 to 1300 was warm and dry.

3 Turning to another facet of energy policy that the greens oppose, Mr. Obama even said that "we're going to have to make some tough decisions about opening up new offshore areas for oil and gas development," implying that the country can expect an announcement along those lines soon. Domestic oil and gas development are another sector of well-paying jobs for blue collar workers that cannot be outsourced to Canada, Mexico, or China.
1 JC comment: The first sentence of the abstract really caught my attention: Given that over the course of the next 1030 years the magnitude of natural decadal variations may rival that of anthropogenically forced climate change on regional scales I dont recall the climate establishment giving this one before. The implications of this is that the warming between 1970 or 1980 to 2000 should be operating under the same givens also.

4 Finally we come to nonsense variables argument made by Burger and Cubasch. Their basic argument here appears to be that CFR methods such as those used by Mann et al (1998), Rutherford et al (2005) and dozens of other groups of climate and paleoclimate researchers, are somehow prone to statistical overfitting in the presence of trends, which leads to the calibration of false relationships between predictors and predictand. So their above claim can be restated as follows: calibration using CFR methods such as Rutherford et al (2005) and multiproxy networks with the attributes (e.g. spatial locations and signal-vs-noise characteristics) similar to those of the proxy network used by Rutherford et al (2005) will produce unreliable reconstructions if the calibration period includes a substantial trend. They believe that such conditions will necessarily lead to the selection of nonsense predictors in reconstructing past variations from the available predictor network.
4 Over land, near-surface? air temperatures are those commonly measured about 1.5 to 2.0 meters above the ground level at official weather stations, at sites run for a variety of scientific purposes, and by volunteer (cooperative?) observers . These stations often experience relocations, changes in instrumentation and/or exposure (including changes in nearby thermally emitting structures), effects of land-use changes (e.g., urbanization), and changing observing practices, all of which can introduce biases into their long-term records. These changes are often undocumented.

3 Now let's look at jobs: Utility MACT and other EPA regulations on the electric power sector have resulted in over 24,000 megawatts of announced power plant retirements located in 20 states. According to the National Economic Research Associates, Utility MACT will destroy 180,000 to 215,000 jobs in 2015. And with other, new EPA regulations on the electric power sector, the economy stands to lose approximately 1.65 million jobs by 2020.
4 As Anthony Watts has often complained, NOAA seem to be very reluctant to divulge how they operate. We do, however, know how the current temperatures are worked out.There are 124 stations in Virginia, split into the six divisions, with a simple average taken of the set of stations in each division. The divisions, as previously noted, are then weighted to give a statewide figure.
0 Manhattan got pounded in 1667 and by the Great Storm of 1693. They were followed by more behemoths in 1788, 1821, 1893, 1944, 1954 and 1992. Other "confluences of severe weather events" brought killer storms like the four-day Great Blizzard of 1888. The 1893 storm largely eradicated Hog Island, and the 1938 "Long Island Express" hit LI as a category 3 hurricane with wind gusts up to 180 mph.
1 It is said frequently that the climatic data for Antarctica for the past 30 years the period for which records are far superior to previous times shows clear signs of mankind's influence. However, it is important to look at such changes in a historical context. This is important else we attribute any and every change seen in the past few decades to mankind alone. When it is done today's changes are seen in a new light.
3 All this activity has created millions of oil patch and downstream jobs. Royalty and tax revenues have skyrocketed, and cheaper natural gas fuels and feed stocks have fostered a manufacturing and petrochemical renaissance.
4 However, the reality is that there are problems with the surface temperature record, and there are problems with feedbacks in climate models, and there are serious questions to be answered regarding the proposed mitigation policies in response. Nothing in Mullers alleged conversion changes any of those issues.
3 As discussed in the July 18 and July 25 TWTWs, the 2014 annual report of the state-owned electricity and natural gas distribution company in Denmark states that, by 2020, the electricity capacity of power plants, including wind and solar, and import capacity will be about 3 times expected maximum consumption. As discussed in the August 8 TWTW, the need for reliable back-up for unreliable solar and wind is a major reason why Denmark and Germany have the highest electricity costs to consumers in Europe and that the relation between non-hydro renewables and consumer costs of electricity is strong and positive the greater the percentage of renewables in the mix, the higher the costs to households.
4 So why does NIWA bother stretching the temperature record over this wasteland of missing and unreliable data, when all seven stations are isolated islands? What purpose is served by the extra decades? A time series commencing in 1930 would offer 70 years more than sufficient to fine-tune the computer models.
4 A number of climate-change metrics have become less alarming over time, ranging from global temperature to hurricanes. Climate models (including that of Hansen at NASAs Goddard Institute) have demonstrably overestimated climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas. But rather than hedge his bets and show humility toward the very complex system he is trying to model, Hansen has called for oil industry executives to be prosecuted and for civil disobedience at coal facilities.
4 The car park asphalt at 6 meters away puts the station rating at CRN4, based on NOAAs site quality rating system used for their Climate Reference Network. Ive found that the vast majority of historical stations in the USA have been affected this way:
4 Often precipitation projections from different models are blended together and averaged, as if adding up a cluster of failures will somehow produce accurate results.
4 Pederson set up the climate and media panel so there were no skeptics on board because he is a dedicated, one might even say fanatical, believer in human-caused global warming and its catastrophic outcome. How do I know? Because last December, I attended a video streaming, arranged by Pederson in a University of Victoria classroom, of an online debate pitting skeptics Bjorn Lomborg and Nigel Lawson against warmists Elizabeth May and George Monbiot.
4 Since people are asking us to bet billions on this dataset, we need more than a well, its kinda like the other datasets that contain known errors to justify their calculations. NASA is not doing the job we are paying them to do. Why should citizen scientists like myself have to dig out these oddities? The adjustments for each station should be published and graphed. Every single change in the data should be explained and justified. The computer code should be published and verified.

0 1.) First things first as the globe has not warmed for 10 years, we no longer use the term global warming, from now on use the term climate change.
0 Now are you going to hear me start yapping that an amazing flip like this over 1-2% of the globe is a sign of global cooling. Of course not since that is pure nonsense. However arguing a cooling trend may be starting because of the cold PDO, which can be seen here with the 3 year meter temperature trend FOR THE ENTIRE GLOBE is something that should be considered.
0 Not only do these charts make it clear that CO2 emissions are not the Earth 's proverbial thermostat, as claimed by the anti-CO2 scientific community, but over the last 10 years the globe has actually been cooling at a trend of -0.5 C per century.
0 Further, weve seen cold in South Africa and Australia / New Zealand as well. This is NOT just a local weather event. Its a regional cooling. That means it is likely to have global implications.
0 According to the measured thermometer data, the hottest decade in the US was the 1930s followed by the 1940s and 1950s. Despite a hot 2012, the current decade only ranks #4.
0 Recent extreme weather cannot be blamed on global warming, because there has not been any global warming. It is as simple as that.
0 7] Canadian national winter temperature departure from 1948-2009 trend has been dropping for 3 years from 3.9C in 2006 to 0.3C in 2009
0 To find just the opposite of what the climate alarmists predict should be occurring as a consequence of the ongoing rise in the air's CO 2 concentration must be a real blow to them. And this is not the first such blow. We reported the similar results of another Antarctic sea ice study just a few months ago ( Recent Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice Extent ), as well the finding that Antarctica has cooled slightly over this period ( Recent Trends in Antarctic Surface Temperatures ). And this is supposed to be the place where global warming is first detected? We'll buy that, which means, of course, that it just ain't happening!
0 If we look at the trend of all the extremes in the satellite era, we see a reduced trend in the 1980s, an increase after the 1998 El Nio, particularly due to cold extremes, then a reduction in extremes in the last ten years.
0 As this accompanying chart obviously indicates, snow extent has actually increased over the short term (see 3-year average curve); and since the beginning of the dataset, winter snows have ranged within a narrow band.
0 All three show a period of higher snow fall around the 1960s and early 1970s. However snowfall in the last decade or two is clearly not unusual when compared with the earlier record up to about 1960 and there appears to be no decreasing trend since 1980. The following chart, comparing actual snowfall amounts for the 1940s with the last decade, makes it all abundantly clear.
0 So Ioverlaid the current data on the 1990 IPCC graph, and it turns out that ice coverage now is similar to 1974.
0 First winter snow extent has been increasing, and four of the five greatest snow extents have been since the year 2000. Does Dr. Robinson have trouble understanding his own graph?
0 But it is not the temperature which is rising there, it is the sea-ice extent. And it really doesn't look consistent with the Cowtan and Way global warming trend supposedly due to alleged warming in the polar regions.
0 So we find that, adding the two poles together, this year there has been much more ice at the summer solstice than the 30-year mean. Therefore, much more sunlight has been reflected than usual, and not less as is implied.
0 Yesterday I wrote about sea level rise, and attempts to measure ice loss in Antarctica via satellite. And again, it is very clear that the results of scientific work are being hijacked in an attempt to push a scary message at us. The analysis of gravimeter measurements start with guesses and inferences, and the result is presented with a huge margin of error, and amounts to less than 1% of the annual ice loss Antarctica experiences every year.
0 The animation below flashes between 2006 and 2015. Unless there isanother summer with strong southerly winds like in 2007, theamount of thick multi-year ice will be back to 2006 levels in a year or two, as the ice age increases.
0 Nothing could be further from the truth. The ice cover in the Antarctic has recently reached a new all-(recorded)-time extent and the ice cover in the Arctic appears to be on a similar path. No wonder as the frost-free days in the Arctic, above 80 N have been fewer in the last two summers and the last winter in North America was brutally cold and long.
0 And if that explanation were not confusing enough, the link at the end of the paragraph is to a 2009 New Scientist article about a paper by Turner et al that has a completely different explanation for the rise in sea ice:
0 The oceans sea ice levels were 44.6% higher than the 1981-2010 average, breaking a previous record set in 2008 by 220,000 square miles.
0 ???In Southern Hemisphere winter months, ice extent has increased by around one percent per decade.??
0 Bild reports that the vessel was on a 5-week expedition to repeat the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier. Ironically, rather than finding warming and open seas, the current expedition has wound up getting trapped by thick sea ice and blizzards that have yet to be penetrated even by modern ice breakers.
0 2010 average ice thickness is approximately the same as 2006 and 2007. It is higher than rotten ice 2008 and 2009.
0 As Glaciergate was breaking, I believe I was the f irst to call for the Nobel Committee to revoke Al Gores and the UN IPCCs share Nobel Peace Prize , despite the fact that Nobel rules prohibit revocation of the Nobel Peace Prize. I said, Screw it, set a new precedent!
0 The Antarctic sea ice extent has been at or near record extent in the past few summers; the Arctic has rebounded in recent years since the low point in 2007; polar bears are thriving; the sea level is not showing acceleration and is actually dropping; cholera and malaria are failing to follow global warming predictions; Mount Kilimanjaro-melt fears are being made a mockery by gains in snow cover; global temperatures have been holding steady for a decade or more as many scientists are predicting global cooling is ahead; deaths because of extreme weather are radically declining; global tropical cyclone activity is near historic lows; the frequency of major U.S. hurricanes has declined; the oceans are missing their predicted heat content; big tornadoes have dramatically declined since the 1970s; droughts are neither historically unusual nor caused by mankind; there is no evidence we are currently having unusual weather; scandals continue to rock the climate fear movement; the Uni

0 In the words of the authors, "continually increasing sea ice extent over the Antarctic Southern Polar Ocean, along with the observed decreasing trends in Antarctic ice surface temperature ( Comiso, 2000 ) over the last two decades, is paradoxical in the global warming scenario resulting from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." Indeed, it would appear to be a major contradiction of that scenario. References

(There are many credible sources of this information, such as the following website maintained by the University of Illinois-Urbana: http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.anom.south.jpg ). Why, I ask, has Mr. Gore not chosen to mention the record growth of sea ice around Antarctica? If the record melting in the Arctic is significant, then the record sea ice growth around Antarctica is, too, I say. If one is insignificant, then the other one is, too.

0 A paper published today in Earth & Planetary Science Letters evaluates snow and ice-mass changes in Antarctica using both satellite altimetry and gravimetry between 2003-2010. The data shows most areas of the ice sheet are stable to increasing in ice mass, including the East Antarctic ice sheet, which alone contains over 80% of the total ice mass of Antarctica. The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica, which overlie geothermal heat sources are found to be losing ice, but represent relatively small regions of the ice sheet. The entire Dronning Maud Land north coast of Antarctica was found to have increasing snow accumulation.

That bowl interior is where the Greenland Sheet has been accumulating even as the edges sluff/melt. Creep decline becomes increasingly self-limited by underlying geology.
0 The melt season was very short, and ended very early. Greenlands surface gained 200 billion tons of ice.
0 The rebound from 2012s record low comes six years after the BBC reported that global warming would leave the Arctic ice-free in summer by 2013.
0 Arctic ice continues to grow at a very fast rate, despite the fact that 2010 is the hottest year on record and the Arctic is the fastest warming place on earth .
0 Some temperature or ice differences are positive, some of them are negative, some of them are greater or smaller than other temperature or ice differences, there are lots of data. But what is important is that there's no evidence that something "stunning" is going on. There has clearly been some quasi-periodic behavior as well as noise in the Arctic sea ice evolution over the recent million of years and what we've observed in the recent 34 years is quite certainly "rather representative" of the behavior that has existed for a much longer time.
0 ???Well, 2013 is almost over,?? Newman points out. ???And contrary to the alarmist predictions by Gore and what critics refer to as his doomsday cult, the latest satellite data show that Arctic ice cover has actually expanded 50 percent over 2012 levels. In fact, during October, sea-ice levels grew at the fastest pace since records began in 1979.??
0 There are claims coming from some communities that the Arctic sea ice is recovering, is getting thicker again, Mark Serreze, director of the Colorado-based centre, told Postmedia News on Wednesday.
0 For instance, you could point out that data collected by The IARC-JAXA Information System clearly demonstrates that contrary to dire predictions of a complete melt, Arctic sea ice concentrations are now rising as they normally do. But that leaves unanswered the one question no one but these musician-scientists have the courage to ask:
0 The big green machine has finally successfully lobbied enough FUDto get the thriving polar bear listed as athreatened species. Never mind the fact that the arctic sea ice has melted before in the last 100 years. See the news release from the Department of the Interior here:
0 Despite all of the headlines recently about record low Arctic ice, sea ice extent has actually been regrowing for the last two weeks, and is nearly back to where it was on 22nd February.
0 In August 2007, the East Siberian Sea ice edge was shrinking very rapidly. This year it is expanding.
0 While Arctic sea ice remains below levels of the last decade, it has recovered about 60% of its mass this year, according to a report in the Daily Mail .
0 ???About 90% of the increase is due to growth of multiyear ice which survives through more than one summer without melting with only 10% growth of first year ice. Thick, multiyear ice indicates healthy Arctic sea-ice cover.
0 Arctic sea ice reaches near-average extent in April Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis
0 Arctic sea ice extent remains the highest since 2005, with only a few weeks left to the melt season.
0 According to US Park Service documents, the Exit Glacier melt rate has dropped in half over the last 125 years.
0 Both the Hotlum and Wintun Glaciers have nearly doubled in size since 1950, says this article on Wikipedia. The Bolam Glacier has increased by half, while the Whitney and Konwakiton Glaciers have grown by a third.
0 Average global atmospheric and oceanic temperatures will drop significantly beginning between 2015 and 2016 and will continue with only temporary reversals until they stabilize during a long cold temperature base lasting most of the 2030s and 2040s.
0 First we learned that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is actually helping us stave off the next inevitable ice age by a few years . Yes, you read that right: the runaway global warming scenario is now off the table; a new ice age is coming for sure , and whatever human warming effects there may be will only make our descent into the deep freeze a little more comfy.
0 Latif made his cooling projections in 2008, and so are not that old (he predicted warm-winters backin 2000). And who can say that the cold winters arent related to his projections of cooling? Latifs projections look to be true, and likely will be truefor the new, current decade.
0 Neither Professor Steffen nor any other scientist can state with certainty whether global temperature in ten years time will be warmer or cooler than today. But given the currently quiet sun, and acknowledging the importance of multi-decadal climatic oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, many scientists currently hypothesize that cooling is more likely than warming over the next two decades.
0 Among his comments from many years of research on solar climate forcing include: Contrary to the IPCCs speculation about man made warming as high as 5.8(degrees)C within the next hundred years, a long period of cool climate with its coldest phase around 2030 is to be expected.
0 German Scientists Show Climate Driven By Natural Cycles Global Temperature To Drop To 1870 Levels By 2100!
0 Many climatologists and astrophysicists believe recent sun spot, Pacific Ocean and global temperature trends suggest that our planet may have entered a cool phase that could last for 25 years. If that is the case, the additional carbon dioxide being emitted by China, India and other developing countries could bring a major additional benefit: helping to protect wildlife habitats, enhance oceanic biota and preserve crop yields under sub-optimal climatic conditions.
0 Through influence the temperature will decrease until 2100 to a value like the one of the last Little Ice Age 1870, the scientists wrote.
0 What I mean by the previous sentence is that if the solar activity drops to zero or near zero, e.g. for two decades, the sea level rise will also be zero or slightly negative, indicating a modest global cooling - regardless of the origin of the slow, currently warming underlying trend.
0 In March, this newspaper further revealed that temperatures are about to drop below the level that the models forecast with 90 per cent certainty.
0 According to geophysicist Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera at the University of Mexico, in about 5 years the Earth will enter a Little Ice Age which will last from 60 to 80 years and may be caused by the decrease in solar activity.
0 This is right on target with forecasts made by Bill Gray years ago, since you are close to where Dr Gray is, why don??t you ask him, My forecast stands, made 4 years ago, that the cooling would start ( it has as you can see on the observed objective data) and by 2030 we are back to where we were in the late 1970s WHEN THE PACIFIC WAS ENDING ITS COLD CYCLE. Look for yourself at the PDO values below:
0 A little bit of cooling in the First World War time, warmed again to 1940, then it cooled to 1976, then it warmed up to the great El Nino of 1998, then it was static for a while and its been cooling since 2003.
0 During the time from about 1350-1850 a Little Ice Age was experienced and is best documented in Europe. This coincided with a period of very low sunspot activity, frigid temperatures and crop failures. NASA reports that such solar patterns are repeating themselves. Most solar scientists predict continued global cooling, not warming.
0 There are a number of reasons the IPCChas avoided any discussion of the possibility the current hiatus could last for at 3 decades. First, that would mean their projections of future global warming are useless. (More on this later.)
0 US solar scientists have announced years ago that the sun appears to be headed into a lengthly spell of low activity , which means that the Earth is far from facing a Global Warming catastrophe and actually headed into a Little Ice Age.
0 While some scientists say the cold is due to global warming, one scientist at thePulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg sees it completely differently: He sees the next ice age approaching soon!
0 As I warn in Not by Fire but by Ice , I think we could see the greatest floods in 11,500 years as we head into the coming ice age. It has nothing to do with global warming; it has to do with the ice-age cycle.
0 Last year, experts told us that man-made CO2 madeMidwesternMarch weather warm. They also tell us that the past year has seen a record increase in CO2. This explains the fifty degree drop in temperatures since last year.
0 While many Americans welcomed a balmy-like February winter, this minor regional warming in some parts of the U.S. was overwhelmed by an otherwise large global cooling. Last time February global temperatures were colder than February 2012 was in 1994 - 18 years prior.
0 The white storm is ???unprecedented for the past 50 years, with two metres (almost seven feet) of snow falling since Friday??, said an official in Mazandaran province, on the Caspian Sea.
0 We are experiencing near record cold, and unprecedented wet conditions in Fort Collins. Yesterday only reached 66 degrees the coldest July 6 since 1904. July 6 temperatures peaked in the 1980s, and have been generally declining ever since.
0 The first 5 months of this year were also too cold, the Belgian Met Office points out. Looking at average temperatures going back to 1833, the past five months were quite exceptional.
0 While we had a new record low in 2012 for the summer minimum, the 2013 rebound made Gore??s predictions a certain failure.
0 YLE News This month has also been particularly cool, especially in central and northern Finland. Temperatures on average reach over 20 degrees Celsius in July throughout the country. Meteorologists say July hasn't been this cool since 1993 , and hasn't been this rainy since the years 2004 and 2007.
0 Brillianttheory, except that Illinois summers are getting cooler, and July 2009 was the coldest July on record in Illinois.
0 The UN beginstheir meeting tomorrow in New York tostopglobal warming, with temperatures forecast to be26 degrees cooler than they were on the same date in 1895, 95 degrees vs. a forecast 69 for tomorrow.
0 The 5-Year average has dropped to 8.9C, a level commonly seen in the 1940s and 50s. Although the cold Spring has been due in large part to the exceptionally cold weather in March, which was the coldest since 1892, both April and May have also been much colder than normal.
0 Scientists in Greenland are getting buried under the ice and snow at -20C during summer.
0 This past winter saw record cold in the Arctic (notable because greenhouse theory predicts "global" warming will occur primarily in that region), heavy snowfall and deadly avalanches in the Alps, and record cold temperatures in the United States including an April snow fall in North Carolina.
0 It's bitterly cold. Horrifically cold! So what does this tell us about global warming?
0 In case you were wondering why alarmists arent talking about Australia any more. Temperatures are running well below normal, with lots of snow in the mountains.
0 And an extra bonus from the ???weather is not climate?? department ??? January 29, 2010 at 39.9 degrees was ten degrees below normal and the second coldest on record.
0 AT GALENA?? THIS JANUARY WILL BE THE COLDEST ON RECORD. THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF -33.5 DEGREES THROUGH YESTERDAY WILL EASILY ENSURE THAT THIS JANUARY SURPASS THE -31.4 DEGREES THAT WAS OBSERVED IN 1971. WEATHER RECORDS AT GALENA DATE BACK TO 1942.
0 The prairie provinces are in a deep freeze, with temperatures dipping to under minus 30 degrees Celsius , and even British Columbia is suffering with unusually cold weather .
0 Last night fell over 1 foot (30 cm) of snow in Gospic so that the total depth is almost 2.5 feet (75 cm)
0 The mercury also dropped to minus 6 degrees Celsius in one town, making it the coldest June Sweden recording in 20 years. The Local adds:
0 The only colder May on record was in 1957, when the average low was minus 2.6 degrees.
0 Major roads in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as nearby provinces Hebei, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, were forced to close due to the heavy snow.

0 Rain on Wednesday brought 20 millimetres to Uluru and kept the temperature below 13 degrees all day, making it the coldest September day on record. Its more than four degrees colder than the previous record, set a little over a week ago.
0 TEMPERATURES AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING WILL LIMIT ACCUMULATIONS ON ROADWAYS OVER MOUNTAIN PASSES?? HOWEVER HEAVY ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 7000 FEET.
0 Stephen McIntyre, a Canadian mathematician who frequently writes articles on climate, stated recently that ???satellite data shows only half the amounts of predicted global warming in the past three decades.??
0 Mann says there is evidence that humans are warming the planet. There cant be. For 200 months there has been no warming at all. Get over it. Get a life.
0 This is exactly what has happened to atmospherically biased climate scientists who have for years used SST maps to prove that increases in atmospheric temperatures are heating the ocean. With the admission that the atmosphere is not warming it is no longer a believable explanation.
0 This fact has already been scientifically assessed because since 1940, the average temperature of the northern hemisphere has diminished by approximately 0,4C, probably because of a decrease in atmospheric transparency due to air pollution.
0 The trend of global temperature since 2001 has been cooling at a rate of -4.0C (-7F) per century. Computer models had predicted a 1F rise in temperature during this same periodthat did not happen, showing that the computer models are invalid.
0 Experts are talking about heatwaves and telling us that the US summers are getting much hotter. In fact, this has been the 47th coolest summer on record so far, and there has been no trend in summer temperatures since 1895. Every summer during the 1930s was hotter than 2013.
0 It is not clear. Despite the CO2 emissions, the Earth has been in a cooling cycle for the last 19 years, during the same time the IPCC's "climate experts" and others were telling us the Earth was going to become dangerously warm.
0 On its own, the CO 2 increase since 2005 should have caused a radiative forcing of 0.24 Watts per square meter, or 0.34 W m 2 after including the influence of all other greenhouse gases. Even without temperature feedbacks, according to the IPCCs methods this forcing should have caused 0.1 C warming. Adding in the IPCCs temperature estimates of temperature feedbacks and of previously-committed global warming should have caused up to 0.3 C warming since January 2005. None has occurred.
0 I know of no obvious reason for the 0.1C temperature rise 1998-2003, nor for the basically flat temperatures before and after.
0 Debates about those claims revolve around several contentious issues. Key among these are: whether there is, in fact, reason for alarm; what reliable evidence supports that supposition; i.e., what degrees of impact do human have versus natural influences on global temperature changes (both warming and cooling); and what trends can be observed and projected to guide prudent responses? It is not my intent to argue that the global climate has been cooling since the late 1970s, but merely to present a case that there is no convincing evidence that it has been warming.
0 The IPCC and other scientists have branded this as a pause in climate change. Ball said that characterization implies that temperatures are temporarily holding steady and will inevitably rise again soon. He said that conclusion is dead wrong.
0 A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming.
0 What this means:The IPCC knows the pause is real, but has no idea what is causing it. It could be natural climate variability, the sun, volcanoes and crucially, that the computers have been allowed to give too much weight to the effect carbon dioxide emissions (greenhouse gases) have on temperature change.
0 The per century cooling trend of this period, a minus 3.5F, took place in spite of the huge warmth produced by two large El Nio events during this 15-year span: 1997-1998 and 2009-2010 .
0 From observations such as these, it is not possible to place any faith in the IPCCs values for climate sensitivity, which have always been highly speculative. In fact, global temperature since 1980 has been rising at half the rate originally predicted by the IPCC in its First Assessment Report in 1990, and, since 1995, has not risen in any statistically-significant sense at all.
0 Finally, I defy anyone to show me an anthropogenic effect anywhere in these results. Most of the proxies that cover the period 1900-2000 show cooling temperatures, not warming temperatures as the authors claim.
0 nan
0 Last months Al Gore / AIT Index had Al Gore ever-so-close to positive territory, and if temperatures had gone up a smidgen more in March Al Gore would have recorded only his second month out of the thirty-eight months since An Inconvenient Truth was released with an average temperature above what it was on that date. But, it was not to be for Al Gore. Temperatures took a big dive down from February to March, going down .18F (.10C).
0 The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 . . . since then, weve actually had temperatures DROPPING !
0 As shown, the 120-month (decadal) trends have been slightly negative since about 2011. In other words, global temperatures have been coolingslightly. Working back in time, they came close to reaching a zero trend (no warming or cooling) for the period ending about January 1997, but they dont quite reach it. That means we have to go back another decade, to January 1987, until we can see the decadal trends reach zero again, but they dont drop appreciably below it. Its not until the late 1970s that a significant decade-long cooling period exists.
0 6) Do you agree that temperatures for the last 40 years are about the same on average as the period 1931-70? If so is there any reason not to regard current temperatures as anything other than "normal" (by 20th C standards!!).
0 5. Inconvenient US Cooling. The government's most accurate, up-to-date temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration covering the period from January 2005 to April 2014 reveal a decade-long cooling trend for the US (contiguous 48 states), see chart above.
0 This makes what has happened in the past decade all the more remarkable. Because the greenhouse effect wants to force the temperature up which in the absence of a cooling influence is what would have happened, the fact that the temperature has remained constant indicates that whatever has been cooling the planet has had to increase in strength at precisely the same rate as the CO2 warming in order to keep the temperature a constant straight line.
4 Prominent global warming alarmist James Hansen admits in a new paper that temperatures are not warming as fast as predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Hansen observes that carbon dioxide emissions are rising faster than IPCC forecasts, yet global temperatures are not following suit. Hansen speculates that emissions from coal-fired power plants emissions are fertilizing the biosphere and providing valuable nutrients that aid tissue growth. The extra tissue growth soaks up atmospheric carbon dioxide, which mitigates some of the IPCC??s expected warming.
0 You have to laugh at the idea of global warming science moving beyond such simplistic questions as whether the globe??s surface is actually warming. No doubt this change of emphasis is unconnected to the failure of the said surface to actually, erm, get any warmer.
0 Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing, annual mean temperature in Germany is cooling. Originally a warming of 0.4C per decade was announced. Instead a cooling of more than 0.2C per decade has actually been observed! Chart by J. Kowatsch, data from the German Weather Service (DWD).
0 Surely the temperature has to start going up. Thats what all the current fuss is about. A few years ago the Met Office said that most of the following five years would be record breakers. When it was obvious they were wrong a new model said there would be no change. It is not a minor downward adjustment as Hickman calls it. Its the difference between record warming and no warming, the difference between our understanding and ignorance of the science. Say what you will about regional climate change, accumulating energy in the system, natural fluctuations, man-made aerosols etc, the temperature has to rise eventually. We are all, sceptic or otherwise, waiting for the global temperature to rise. We have been since 1997. --David Whitehouse, The Global Warming Policy Foundation, 10 January 2013
0 Over the last decade, temperatures have fallen. This is due to all the CO2 we pumped into the atmosphere 30-50 years ago.
0 10. The claim that we must act now are misleading because it implies temperatures are rising at a dangerous rate. In fact, global temperatures since 1998 have not passed that 1998 peak, and early 2008 global average temperatures are marginally less than the equivalent period of 1988 (repeating: 1988, not 1998).
0 Rebuttal: Here the Greens make a huge blunder. First off, theres not been any warming in 12 years. So how can anyone claim temperatures continue their rise? The end of the warming coincided with the end of the 60-year PDO warm phase, which has impacted temperatures over the last several hundred years, see the correlation in the chart that follows:
0 Just like global temperatures, Arctic ones have been flat. Yet Arctic amplification is supposed to be driving temperatures there up at much faster rates.
0 Why do you not mention that the global mean temperature of the earth has not risen over the past 18 years, even though the CO2 atmospheric concentration of the atmosphere has risen during the same period?
0 In other words, in 2009 Murphy was writing about a global cooling (not warming) trend that even climate alarmist Phil Jones admitted began in 1998.
0 UN Trapped in Climate Turmoil CHURCHVILLE, VAThe man-made warming activists at the UN are trapped in turmoil over how to deal with the earths lack of warming since 1998. A week or so ago, the UN climate panel circulated a draft statement that would have admitted were unlikely to have any further earth-warming for the next 30 years because climate change signals are expected to be relatively small compared to natural climate variability.
0 The stopping of the rise in global average temperature after 2000-2001 indicates that the hypothesis and prediction made by the IPCC need serious revision. I have been suggesting during the last several years that there are at least two natural components that cause long-term climate changes.
0 In all this discussion what happened to global temperature immediately before the standstill is often neglected. Many assume that since the recent warming period commenced about 1980 global temperature rose until 1998 and then the surface temperature at least got stuck. Things are however not that simple, and far more interesting.
0 The ACC report says that 2000-09 was the warmest decade since modern measuring began. But that is because it commenced at a warm level. To pick another decade, 2003-12 was notably cool in comparison.
0 In addition, a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres finds that daily temperature range in China decreased from 1962 to 2011 , and that this decrease was due to a decrease in maximum temperatures related to a decrease of sunshine durations over this period. Similar to the findings of this paper, examination of the raw global temperature data shows a significant increase in minimum temperatures over the period 1962-1989, and then leveling off 1989-present. However, over the entire period 1940-present, there is no trend in minimum, maximum, or average global temperature anomalies.
0 I suspect in response to that slowdown in surface warming statement we might see some flawed arguments that global warming continues, along with some graphs that show long-term (1900 to 2014) and short-term (1998-2014) trends are comparable. See my Figure 1. Similar graphs have appeared around the blogosphere.
0 * There has been no statistical global warming for the past 17 years most of today's high school students haven't witnessed it in their lifetimes.
0 Morano: "Global temperatures have been at a standstill. How do you make that sound scary? You make a bunch of scary predictions about a hundred years from now and you say "Hey it's worse than we thought' You respond: "What's worse? Global temperatures haven't gone up' and the climate activists answer is "The predictions of the future are now much worse than they were a few years ago.
0 For the first time, half of the world??s heads of government met in one place. And what did they talk about? Ending poverty? Nah. Making free trade freer? Nopenhagen. After 15 straight years with no statistically-significant ???global warming?? on any measure, they talked about the need to Save The Planet from ??? er ??? ???global warming??. After nine straight years of statistically-significant, rapid global cooling, culminating in a snowstorm of unprecedented severity and extent that swept right across Europe and North America, they tried to tell each other, and us, how urgent the ???global warming?? problem was, and how necessary it was to reach a legally-binding deal to shut down the economies of the capitalist West wholesale.
0 Unfortunately, for all those scientists who went along with the scheme, now, over a decade later, there is a big problem. Contrary to what all those scientists living on their Federal research grants predicted, the world hasn??t been getting warmer. In fact, for the last 7 years, there has been no warming at all, which has been verified even by, for example, Michel Jarraud of the World Meteorological Organization. He??s their Secretary General. He reluctantly admitted that global temperatures have not risen since 1998, according to a BBC article. Global snowfall is at record levels and there are fewer, not more, hurricanes.
0 Focussing on the recent period in more detail, the onset of the current pause coincides with a maximum in upper ocean heat uptake around 2002, and may reflect a recovery both from Mount Pinatubo and from the record 1997/98 El Nio. A recent study (Guemas et al, 2013) shows that, in 2002, the upper ocean below the mixed layer took up heat, while the mixed layer and sea surface temperature did not warm. The onset of the pause may therefore have been caused by ocean processes, predominantly in the tropical Pacific, in which energy trapped by greenhouse gases was buried below the surface of the ocean.
0 The new argument therefore is that the temperature has not risen over the last 10 years. This is indeed correct, both the GISTEMP series and the HadCRUT4 dataset in which missing areas have been interpolated by Cowtan & Way show a trend of 0.00 K/decade over 20052014. To investigate further why the trend has been zero since 2005 it is useful to consider the land and ocean separately.
0 The twentieth century warming trend found elsewhere could not be identified in our proxy record, nor was it found in the corresponding meteorological data used for our study.
0 And I say that knowing there has been a pause in temperatures since 1998. Like James Hansen. Its easy to see. But you know what? There have been pauses beforetwo in the modern temperature recordand when they finished, temperatures did not resume a random nature. They just kept climbing. The pause has been a plateau. Looking at the temperature record would have us bet (not the farm, not our livelihood, but a modest wager) that when this pause concludes temperatures will rise again.
0 The satellite datasets had shown no warming for 18 years 4 months (UAH) or 18 years 5 months (RSS), and the ocean, perhaps the best indicator of the underlying warming rate, had been warming at a rate equivalent to less than a quarter of a degree per across the entire 11-year run of bathythermograph data.
0 "Not only does the RSS satellite dataset show no global warming from December 1996 to April 2015, which is more than half of the entire satellite record," Monckton writes , "But the warming trend since 1900 is roughly 0.8C per century, well within natural variability." NOAA also expects that the higher CO2 levels will remain that way through May, but drop to lower levels as plants in the Northern Hemisphere begin to bloom, utilizing the CO2 for photosynthesis in the spring and summer.
0 Despite the warming hiatus, Knutti is convinced there is no reason to doubt either the existing calculations for the climate activity of greenhouse gases or the latest climate models.
0 Figure 6. Despite a near-linear increase of 2 atm/year in CO2 concentration (NOAA, 2013, gray), the least-squares linear-regression trend (bright blue) on the RSS satellite monthly global mean lower-troposphere anomalies (dark blue) has been zero for 17 years 3 months (207 months).
0 NASA has condensed all we need to know about climate change over the last 60 years into a 15 second video. I suppose they mean CAGW when they use climate change. They described the warming as unprecedented and appear to have a new response to the pause in increasing temperature. Gavin Schmidt is concerned that the temperature hasnt decreased over this period. First they didnt predict the pause and now they have another concern?
0 Of course the confusion here may be worsened by the fact that we aren't "currently seeing" any climate change by the headline measure: there has been no global warming for perhaps 15 years.
0 6. Inconvenient Lack of Global Warming. According to the most recent Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellite data through May 2014, the global warming trend in the nearly 18 years since September 1996 is zero (see chart above, source here).
0 Fossil fuels allowed man to live his life as a proud human, but the IPCC asserts its use causes catastrophic global warming. Fortunately, the global warming claim by the IPCC that For the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emission scenario is not supported by observations as shown in Figure 1, which shows a plateau for the global mean temperature trend for the last decade.
0 From 1910 to 1940 there was an increase in global average temperature of over that 30-year period, Moore said. Then there was a 30-year pause until 1970. This was followed by an increase of during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature.
0 The plot below needs little explanation. The globally average surface temperature hasnt warmed in over 18 years according to the RSS satellite dataset.
0 #5. CO2 is not even causing the much ballyhooed, hoped-for, at a minimum, tiny "statistically significant" warming. Indeed, for time spans now approaching two decades statistically significant warming is nowhere to be found - in fact, the RSS lower atmosphere satellite measurements show no statistically significant warming over the last 23 years
0 Knappenberger noted that despite the panels climate models, the earth does not appear to have warmed over the past 15 years.
0 Dr. Santer also thinks that volcanic aerosols are an important factor in the hiatus, but probably only up to 25%. He acknowledges that natural long term cycles (mainly the AMO and the PDO ) may contribute significantly, but these are poorly understood and not in the models. Some of the models do attempt to capture the shorter term ENSO cycle, or parts of it. ENSO is clearly not the cause of the hiatus.
0 The highest recent rate of warming based on its linear trend occurred during the 170-month period that ended about 2004 2006, but warming trends have dropped drastically since then. There was a similar drop in the 1940s, and as youll recall, global surface temperatures remained relatively flat from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. Also note that the mid-1970s was the last time there had been a 170-month period with a global warming rate that lowbefore recently.
0 The Great Pause is a growing embarrassment to those who had told us with substantial confidence that the science was settled and the debate over. Nature had other ideas. Though more than two dozen more or less implausible excuses for the Pause are appearing in nervous reviewed journals, the possibility that the Pause is occurring because the computer models are simply wrong about the sensitivity of temperature to manmade greenhouse gases can no longer be dismissed.
0 The last time global surface temperatures warmed at this low a rate for a 205-month period was the late 1970s, or about 1980. Also note that the sharp decline is similar to the drop in the 1940s, and, again, as youll recall, global surface temperatures remained relatively flat from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s.
0 Over the past 15 years the rate of global warming has slowed and more recently almost stalled.
0 The highest recent rate of warming based on its linear trend occurred during the 163-month period that ended about 2004, but warming trends have dropped drastically since then. There was a similar drop in the 1940s, and as youll recall, global surface temperatures remained relatively flat from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. Also note that the mid-1970s was the last time there had been a 161-month period without global warmingbefore recently.
0 44) " This is not an existential threat to the mainstream theory of climate."
0 Baltimore sea level is rising at about the same rate as it was in 1910, when global temperatures were supposedly cold and falling. Obviously what is happening in Baltimore has nothing to do with global warming.
0 It is seen that the rate of rise during 1930-1950 was comparable to, if not larger than, the value in recent years. This IPCCs analysis does not support an acceleration in the rate of sea level rise in the latter 20 th century, and hence the data does not support the IPCCs conclusion of a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcings to the global mean sea level rise since the 1970s.
0 The blue line shows atmospheric CO2 during the same period. CO2 has risen substantially during the last 50 years, but the rate of sea level rise has been constant.
0 Temporal comparisons at five bay stations over two periods, 1944-1975 and 1976-2007, suggest that, while RSL continues to rise at some of the highest rates found along the U.S. Atlantic coast, there is presently no evidence of a statistically significant increase marking an acceleration in RSL rise at any of the five bay stations.
0 A new discussion paper published in Ocean Science evaluates multi-mission satellite sea level records and shows that the rate of sea level rise has greatly decelerated since ~2002, as has been documented in prior research finding sea level rise decelerated 31% since 2002, and decelerated 44% since 2004 to less than 7 inches per century . This is obviously the opposite of climate model predictions in response to a steady rise in CO2 greenhouse gas levels, but is compatible with the ongoing "pause" of global warming.
0 The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people . In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.
0 Another grossly inaccurate claim which totally ignores our adaptive response involves sea level rise. Al Gore likes to show maps of what coastal areas look like presently, and what they would look like assuming a multi-meter sea level rise. A dramatic section of Gores An Inconvenient Truth showed some before and afters of coastal locations under Gores scenario of a 20 foot sea level rise that would happen f Greenland melted or broke up and slipped into the seaor half of Greenland and half of Antarctica melted or broke up and slipped into the sea. For a dose of reality, a recent paper published in Geophysical Research Letters pegged the current rate of sea level rise contributed by Antarctica and Greenland combined at 6 inches/century. How inconvenient.
0 Conclusion: Tide gauge station analysis confirms global sea level rise is modest and not dangerously accelerating as long predicted by the IPCC's climate models and its "experts."
0 For the last hundred years, the ocean has risen 20 cm but for the previous hundred years the ocean also has risen 20 cm and for the last 300 years, the ocean has also risen 20 cm per 100 years. So there is no unusual rise in sea level. And to be sure you understand that I will repeat it. There is no unusual rise in sea level, Giaever said.
0 This is confirmed by the annual Atlantic Ocean Sea Level data. Refer to Figure 8. Atlantic Ocean Sea Levels remained relatively flat in 2006, then dropped in 2007. http://i34.tinypic.com/m7b994.jpg Figure 8
0 Sea level rise is not accelerating. In fact the recent rise since 1993 is similar to the 1930-1950 period.
0 (1) The official Australian claim of a present sea level rise in the order of 5.4mm/year is significantly exaggerated (Figure 3).
0 The critics last remark in this section seems to obfuscate the rather obvious point that we currently cannot say that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Without such evidence, the choice of whether to be concerned or not is essentially a matter of personal preference.
0 What astonished me was the sea levels first recorded by the Topex Poseidon satellite array showed virtually no rise at all from 1993-2001. Surely not, I thought. I asked sea-level expert Nils Axel-Morner, and he confirmed: ???Yes, it is as bad as that. ??? Now, given that Envisat (the European satellite) showed no rise from 2003-2011 (until it was adjusted) that means we have almost 20 years of raw satellite data showing very little rise.
0 As for records of sea-level change, tide-gauge measurements indicate no acceleration in sea-level rise in the 20th century.24 Records of sea level, based on precise measurements made by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellites, show a small trend of 2 mm per year in sea-level rise from 1993 to 1997.25 These measurements imply that if greenhouse gases continue to rise and the global temperature increases as much as the computer simulations say, the estimated rise in sea level over the next 100 years will be less than one foot.
0 Sea levels, after allowing for rising/falling land surfaces, have risen over the last 30 years by between 62mm at North Shields, in the North East, and 48mm in Newlyn in the South West. In other words about 6 to 8 inches per century, and about the same rate it has been rising at since the late 19thC.
0 Dr Kench says the growth of the islands can keep pace with rising sea levels.
0 If we take Rahmstorfs 1993 2006 period value of 3.3 mm/year, then we see that sea level rise has actuallyslowed down by 3%, and not risen 60%. The tricks being used by alarmist climate scientists are becoming ever more obvious anddesperate.
0 Almost all of the apparent rise in sea level is due to land subsidence, not sea level rise. The rate of rise on the East Coast is at least 10X higher than on the West Coast because the land isnt sinking on the West Coast.
0 A new paper by White et al , concludes that Australian sea level rises are similar to global measurements (so not a bad proxy for the world), and that during times when CO2 levels were much lower ??? like before World War II, sea levels were rising at the same speed (or possibly faster) than they are today.
0 Tide gauge data show that sea level is rising somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 mm/year. If a short person stood on the beach motionless for one thousand to three thousand years, they might be in danger of drowning.
0 14. Pachauri said that he had seen for himself the damage done in Bangladesh by sea-level rise. Just one problem with that. There has been no sea-level rise in Bangladesh. At all. In fact, according to Professor Moerner, who visited it recently and was the only scientist on the trip to calibrate his GPS altimeter properly by taking readings at two elevations at least 10 meters apart, sea level in Bangladesh has actually fallen a little, which is why satellite images show 70,000 sq. km more land area there than 30 years ago. Pachauri may well have seen some coastal erosion: but that was caused by the imprudent removal of nine-tenths of the mangroves in the Sunderban archipelago to make way for shrimp-farms.
0 (Never mind that sea level hasnt risen an inch in California during the past century.)
0 Funny that the sea level record shows no acceleration of sea level rise , despite attempts to show otherwise.
0 Right to survive: The rights of some Parties to survive are threatened by the adverse impacts of climate change, including sea level rise. At 2 inches per century? Oh, come off it! The Jason 2 satellite shows that sea-level has dropped over the past three years.

0 Environment & Energy reports on the Nature paper we highlighted 2 weeks ago finding no increase of climate variability over the past 50 years . According to the authors, "Our findings contradict the view that a warming world will automatically be one of more overall climatic variation" and "Evidence from Greenland ice cores shows that year-to-year temperature variability was probably higher in some past cold periods." Furthermore, the paper finds, "Many climate models predict that total variability will ultimately decrease under high greenhouse gas concentrations..." The paper corroborates other peer-reviewed papers , the IPCC SREX Report , and the Congressional testimony of Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr. & Dr. John Christy finding no evidence of any increase of extreme weather or climate variability with global warming.
0 CO2 Science Although climate alarmists continue to claim the world will experience more extreme weather as the planet warms, this study clearly suggests -- as the three researchers who conducted it conclude -- that, in China, global warming may actually imply "a possible reduction of hail occurrence."
0 There continues to be little evidence that the recent increase in storminess over the UK is related to man-made climate change.
0 Those fearing catastrophic global warming often point to increased drought as one of the scariest scenarios of climate change. But new research at Princeton University indicates there has actually been little change in drought over the past 60 years, and that the index frequently used to predict drought trends has led to inaccurate findings. The study, published in the journal Nature, points out the so-called Palmer Drought Severity Index is too simplistic in its assessment of precipitation and temperature, with one researcher saying it makes it seem as though it will never rain again. It appears these doubts about drought are drying up yet more climate alarmism.
0 Compared with the likely benefits to both human health and food production from CO2-induced global warming, the possible disadvantages from, say, a slight increase in either the frequency or the intensity of extreme weather events is very small beer. It is, in fact, still uncertain whether there is any impact on extreme weather events as a result of warming (increased carbon emissions, which have certainly occurred, cannot on their own affect the weather: it is only warming which might). The unusual persistence of heavy rainfall over the UK during February, which led to considerable flooding, is believed by the scientists to have been caused by the wayward behaviour of the jetstream; and there is no credible scientific theory that links this behaviour to the fact that the earth's surface is some 0.8C warmer than it was 150 years ago.
0 8. The decade of the 2000s, with the highest atmospheric CO2 levels ever, failed to produce any noteworthy temperature records but one, and severe weather records plummeted from the pace established during 1990s
0 The last days with >15mm were in 2008, and neither exceeded 18mm. Contrast this with other years on record, when such days were more frequent, and much more intense. For instance, January 1961, which holds the record of 27.37mm, or the winter of 1979/80 when there were four days of more than 15mm.
0 The 1930s also had the most daily record maximum temperatures.
0 More inconvenient results for Al Gore and the mouthpiece of ???Forecast the Facts?? Brad Johnson who like to claim that tropical storms will increase due to global warming.

0 1. Between 1954 and 2012, there has been a downward trend in the frequency of strong to violent tornadoes in the US, and that decline is statistically significant at the 1% level (see red line in chart). On average, there has been a decline of almost 0.40 violent tornadoes every year since 1954, or a decline of almost 4 violent tornadoes every decade.

0 One hundred degree days occur about half as often as they did in the 19th century, and the hottest summer Greg experienced was his very first one, in 1954.
0 The unusually quiet 2013 fire season continued a long-term trend in declining wildfires. From 1962 through 1982, for example, at least 100,000 wildfires occurred in the United States every year. Since 1982, however, not a single year has registered 100,000 wildfires. During the past decade, an average of 73,000 wildfires occurred each year. During the 1970s, by contrast, an average of 155,000 wildfires occurred each year.
0 At the conference, I presented the same original research that I recently gave at the American Meteorological Society conference in New Orleans. I serve on the Probability and Statistics Committee of the AMS. This work was based on a paper I wrote and is about to appear in the Journal of Climate that shows that the number of tropical storms and hurricanes have not increased in number or intensity since we have had reliable satellite measurements. I also find that previous crude statistical methods others have used to analyze hurricanes have given misleading results.
0 But , far more serious were the droughts in the zones to the North and South. In the Sahel between 200,000 and 400,000 died in the drought of 1972-73.

0 Ryan Maue : A year ago, I walked into a Tallahassee Borders and snapped an IPhone photo (thats my thumb) of Al Gores new book cover and marveled at the locations of hurricanes in a globally warmed future. The book was released at the tail end of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, which uncorked one of the quietest years on record . With Copenhagen, Cancun, and the hottest year ever come and gone, you would think that global climate disruption was spinning up cyclones with reckless abandon. Remember, after Katrina in 2005, scientists published alarming papers linking increases in hurricane activity worldwide to global warming. Fast forward 5-years: the inconvenient truth is that aside from the Atlantic basin , global tropical cyclone or hurricane activity during 2010 has tanked to the lowest levels in decades .
0 The past 4 years have seen 51 total landfalling hurricanes, also on the low end -- the least is 41 (1978-1981) and the most is 80 (four periods, most recently 2004-2007).
0 Despite warnings from those concerned about global warming, the 2006 hurricane season passed largely without incident. This points out, according to David Ridenour of the National Center for Public Policy Research, the continuing difficulties surrounding climate science. Comments Ridenour: ???The number of hurricanes was 38 percent below the number originally forecast by our government. And the number of hurricanes that qualified as ???major?? fell 50 percent below those forecasts. If we can??t depend on hurricane forecasts made six months ahead of time, how can we expect to depend on predictions about the behavior of hurricanes decades from now. Sadly much of our climate science seems to be more based on politic science.??
0 In a region of the globe where climate models predict the effects of CO 2 -induced global warming to be most evident, the past quarter-century has seen no change in the number of fall (June-November) storms.
0 Got that? In no US region is there strong statistical evidence for flood magnitudes increasing with increasing CO2. This is precisely the opposite of the conclusion expressed in the draft report, which relies on Hirsch and Ryberg (2011) to express the opposite conclusion.
0 nan
0 Despite this strong evidence for a warming planet, greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia. The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave. It is not known whether, or to what exent, greenhouse gas emissions may affect the frequency or intensity of blocking during summer. It is important to note that observations reveal no trend in a daily frequency of July blocking over the period since 1948, nor is there an appreciable trend in the absolute values of upper tropospheric summertime heights over western Russia for the period since 1900.
0 I find this kind of analysis totally unconvincing, and it does not recognize the role of natural internal variability such as the Arctic Oscillation, La Nina, etc in producing floods. None of the recent floods are extreme in historical context.
0 Active Tornado Seasons, Big Outbreaks and Stronger tornadoes Have been Shown to Be Associated With La Ninas and Natural Variability in the Pacific
0 Consider who the skeptics are that Trenberth is referring to. This quote was supposedly in response to a group of scientists who contend that the link between global warming and hurricanes is thus far weak and undetectable. These skeptics lay out their case in a soon-to-be-published article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) entitled Hurricanes and global warming. The skeptics who wrote the article are: Roger Pielke, Jr., a leading researcher on risk and loss association with severe storms and hurricanes; Christopher Landsea, a leading researcher on hurricanes and climate; Kerry Emanuel, a leading hurricane modeler; Max Mayfield, the head of the National Hurricane Center; Jim Laver, head of the Climate Prediction Center; and Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center. According to Pielke Jr., the papers lead author, the purpose of the paper was to provide a concise, largely non-technical, scientifically rigorous, globally inclusive, and interdisciplinary perspective on the state of current understandings of hurricanes and global warming that is explicitly discussed in the context of policy.
0 Woodhouse and Lukas?? streamflow reconstructions indicated, in their words, that ???the 20th century gage record does not fully represent the range of streamflow characteristics seen in the prior two to five centuries.?? Of greatest significance, in this regard, was probably the fact that ???multi-year drought events more severe than the 1950s drought have occurred,?? and that ???the greatest frequency of extreme low flow events occurred in the 19th century,?? with a ???clustering of extreme event years in the 1840s and 1850s.??
0 So what to expect in 2009? Well, the last Northern Hemisphere storm was Typhoon Dolphin in middle December of 2008, and no ACE has been recorded so far. The Southern Hemisphere is below normal by just about any definition of storm activity (unless you have access to the Elias sports bureau statistic creativity department), and the season is quickly running out. With La Nina-like conditions in the Pacific, a persistence forecast of below average global cyclone activity seems like a very good bet. Now if only the Dow Jones index didn??t correlate so well with the Global ACE lately??
0 During the period 1900-1940, when most of the 20th century's one-degree Fahrenheit temperature increase occurred, there were 7 years of moderate-to-severe drought.
0 Twenty-seven climate scientists concluded decadal variations in the number of U.S. heat and cold waves do not correlate that closely with the warming observed over the United States. The drought years of the 1930s had the most heat waves, while the 1980s had the highest number of cold waves. 7
0 The exact opposite is true. Heatwaves have become much less common in the US, and their duration has become much shorter.
0 In 1933, the US was hit by two major hurricanes a week apart. CO2 was wellbelowHansens safe level of 350 PPM at the time.
0 Yet another article has appeared in a leading journal of this subject. The piece is by Chunzai Wang and Sang-Ki Lee of NOAAs Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami; the research was funded by NOAA. The begin their article noting the 2005 hurricane season is the most active year on record, with 28 named tropical storms in the Atlantic basin and 15 of them reaching hurricane intensity. The recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity has fueled a debate on the role of global warming in the increase. (Theres the d-word again that we thought wasnt used anymore!). The last sentence of Wang and Lees first paragraph tips the world off that this piece is not headed to the top of the hurricane alarmists lists. This paper uses observational data to demonstrate that the attribution of the recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity to global warming is premature and that global warming may decrease the likelihood of hurricanes making landfall in the United States.
0 Since Obama took office, the US has averaged 0.6 hurricane landfalls per year. This is the fewest hurricanes of any president since at least 1850. By contrast, Grover Clevelands presidency averaged more than five times as many hurricanes per year as Obamas.
0 Media hype calls the latest cyclone to hit Pacific island of Vanuatu worst in history. But actual scientific evidence shows cyclones have not increased in energy nor is there any evidence of a higher frequency.
0 Recent analyses in changes in severe local weather (tornadoes, thunder days, lightning and hail) in a few selected regions provide no compelling evidence for widespread systematic long-term changes. (Source: IPCC, 2001, TAR-02-2, Chapt. 2.7.4., Summary, S.163-164).
0 " claims that 2004 set an all-time record for the number of tornadoes in the United States. Tornado frequency has not increased; rather, the detection of smaller tornadoes has increased. If we consider the tornadoes that have been detectable for many decades (F-3 or greater), there is actually a downward trend since 1950."
0 This year had the fewest tornadoes on record in the US, and the second fewest number of severe tornadoes, with seventeen. Only 1987 had fewer severe tornadoes, with fifteen.
0 Wealthier, more technologically advanced societies are better able to anticipate, withstand, and recover from climate change, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters. There is no evidence that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent or severe in this century.30 But let s assume for the sake of argument that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide will warm the planet in ways that increase the number and intensity of severe storms. What type of insurance policy would offer the most protection under such circumstances?
0 In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale
0 First things first the title is wrong. We have presented many essays recently showing that hurricane activity is not increasing in terms of frequency and intensity or that any increase is simply a return to what was commonly observed decades or centuries ago. When we were writing about hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, or Gulf of Mexico (or even the Northeast Pacific), our use of the term hurricane was correct. These severe tropical storms appear in many other parts of the world, and when they occur over the Northwest Pacific Ocean and west of the International Date Line, they are called typhoons. Hurricanes near Australia and in the Indian Ocean are sometimes called Willy-Willies by the locals. However, in the scientific community, hurricanes, typhoons, and Willy-Willies are all called tropical cyclones.
0 As EPA's own data show, despite allegedly "unprecedented" warming, U.S. air quality has improved decade-by-decade since 1970 as emissions declined. The report blames climate change for the Midwest drought of 2012. But the government's own analysis concluded otherwise: "Neither ocean states nor human-induced climate change, factors that can provide long-lead predictability, appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn producing regions of central Great Plains." The Assessment ignores substantial data and research finding no long-term increase in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones and no trend in extreme weather-related damages once losses are "normalized' (adjusted for changes in population, wealth, and consumer price index).
0 Lin & Chan, 2015, a study published in Nature Communications, finds that the destructive potential of tropical cyclones (???typhoons??) in the most active and hazardous tropical cyclone basin on Earth, the Western North Pacific Main Development Region, decreased by 35% over the past decade.Lin and Chan use a metric called the Power Dissipation Index (PDI) to measure the destructive potential of Asia-Pacific typhoons. The PDI is a product of three factors: storm frequency, duration, and intensity. In the past decade, typhoon intensity increased due to increases in ocean heat content. However, typhoon frequency and duration decreased due to stronger vertical wind shear and lower vorticity in the storm genesis region. The declines in frequency and duration overpowered the increase in intensity, producing a net decrease in PDI of approximately 35%.Based on climate modeling studies, Lin and Chan project that global warming will induce an additional 15% decrease in the Asia-Pacific PDI. In their words, ???Although both the intensity and duration increased under global warming, there was an even larger typhoon frequency reduction of 25.7%. As a result, the typhoon PDI decreased by 15.2%.??
0 The current drought was very unusual in the speed of its onset, with PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index) dropping from slightly wet to severe drought in just five months. In the Illinois Division 1 instrumental record, this has occurred only once before, in 1936. But the droughts current severity has been matched or exceeded on numerous occasions in the past, according to both the instrumental and tree-ring records. ?

0 So far, the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season is comparable to 2006 and 2007, much weaker than in 2005, the year that made it so tempting to abuse tropical storms for dirty left-wing politics by emitting foggy hypotheses about SUV-hurricane links.
0 Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr. has authored an excellent essay in yesterdays Wall Street Journal that put the kibosh on the new normal meme seen here . As Pielke clearly shows, hurricanes like Sandy are not the new normal and the data tells us the USA is in a hurricane drought.
0 As for hurricanes, like Irene, the skeptical scientists report that storm frequency does not track with global temperature fluctuations and they add that historical trends show that storms were worse during the Medieval period of about 9501250 AD.
0 Over the period 1944-1996, decreasing trends were found for (1) the total number of hurricanes, (2) the number of intense hurricanes, (3) the annual number of hurricane days, (4) the maximum attained wind speed of all hurricane storms averaged over the course of a year, and (5) the highest wind speed associated with the strongest hurricane recorded in each year. In addition, the authors report that the total number of Atlantic hurricanes making landfall in the United States has decreased over an extended 1899-1996 time period, and that normalized trends in hurricane damage in the United States between 1925 and 1996 reveal such damage to be decreasing at a rate of 728 million dollars per decade. What it means
0 The first problem they have is that the comparisons are absurd. The Dust Bowl saw muchlongerlasting and more extensive droughts. Compare 2012 to 1934 below.
0 An interesting aspect of the season was its early start, with two tropical storms, Alberto and Beryl, developing in May before the season officially began. Also, this is the seventh consecutive year that no major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5) have hit the United States. The only major hurricane this season was Hurricane Michael, a Category 3 storm that stayed over the open Atlantic.
0 Florida has not been hit by any hurricane for seven years, the longest such period on record.
0 Hurricanes have not increased in the United States in frequency, intensity, or normalized damage since at least 1900. Currently, the U.S. is enjoying a period of over eight years without a Category 3 or stronger hurricane making landfall. Government data also indicate no association between use of fossil fuels and tornado activity.
1 In a new book worth reading, The Whole Story of Climate by E. Kirsten Peters, the author brings a wealth of knowledge to the subject from the standpoint of a geologist. As to the claim that carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of a warming that is not happening, she points out that The fact is, if human beings had remained hunter-gatherers throughout our entire history, never producing a single molecule of greenhouse gases through agriculture or industry, climate today would still be changing. It would be lurching toward higher temperatures, crashing toward vastly colder temperatures, or at least swinging toward something different from what has been. Thats just the nature of Earths climate.
1 We cannot stop carbon emissions because most of them come from volcanoes, he said. It is a normal element cycled around in the earth and my science, which is looking back in time, is saying we have had a planet that has been a green, warm wet planet 80 per cent of the time. We have had huge climate change in the past and to think the very slight variations we measure today are the result of our life we really have to put ice blocks in our drinks.
1 Michaels, Knappenberger, Lindzen, along with most of us, recognize that global temperatures have been warming in fits-and-starts since the "little ice age" ended in the mid-1800s.
1 As the widget shows, my model predicts for the imminent future a slight warming trending from 2011 to 2016. This modulation is due to the 9.1 year (lunar/solar) and the 10-11 year (solar/planetary) cycles that just entered in their warming phase. This decadal pattern should be distinguished from the fast ENSO oscillations that are expected to produce fast periods of warming and fast period of cooling during these five years as it happened from 2000 to 2012. Thus, the fact that during LaNina cooling phase, as right now, the temperature may actually be cooling, does not constitute a proof that my model is wrong as Leif claimed.
1 The variations in cloud water show some interesting low-frequency behavior. I have previously discussed the fact that these cloud water variations are correlated with CERES-measured net radiative flux, and so provide a proxy measurement for the net radiative imbalance over the ocean which suggest some portion of recent warming was simple due to a natural decrease in cloud cover.
1 We have heard a million times that if we dont stop emitting greenhouse gases, our inexcusable actions will result in a warmer earth, and the warming of the planet will cause icecaps and mountain glaciers to melt and sea level to rise. Island nations will be drowned, coastlines around the world will go underwater, Florida will cease to exist, and the World Trade Center Memorial could someday be a sight seen only by scuba enthusiasts. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says very clearly in the Summary for Policymakers Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century. The IPCC crew reminds us that Global average sea level in the last interglacial period (about 125,000 years ago) was likely 4 to 6 m higher than during the 20th century, mainly due to the retreat of polar ice. It seems that sea levels fell and rose many times in the past and long before humans had any chance interfere with the natural order of things. There is no reason whatsoever to expect sea level to remain constant it never has and it never will.
1 Since there is no evidence of a manmade component in the warming of the global oceans over the past 30 years, the natural additional warming of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the North Atlanticabove the natural warming of the sea surface temperatures for the rest of the global oceanshas been a major contributor to the natural loss of Arctic sea ice over the satellite era. Add to that the weather events that happen every couple of years and we can pretty much dismiss the hubbub over this years record low sea ice in the Arctic basin. Personally, Id find it comicalif the desperation on the parts of AGW proponents wasnt so evident. That makes it sad.
1 Examination of ice cores suggests that it takes several hundred years for Earths vast oceans to fully adjust to cycles of global warming and cooling. Thus todays oceans may be still warming, expanding and degassing in gradual adjustment to the medieval warm era which peaked about 700 years ago.
1 Update: I am intrigued by the argument made by Professor Murry Salby in a lecture here (and discussed by Judith Curry here ) that the increase in carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere over the past century or so may be attributable 80% to the warming of the oceans rather than to fossil fuel emissions. In other words that the warming generated the CO2, rather than vice versa -- as happened in most of the Vostok ice core record from Antarctica. He points out that the rate of increase dropped sharply after Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and rose sharply after the very warm El Nino in 1998. He also takes issue with the argument that the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 is necessarily a fingerprint of fossil fuels.
1 The current warm period is no anthropogenic product, rather it is the natural result of a repeating 1000-year cycle that goes back far into the past. Todays warm period does not even reach the temperatures seen in the past warm periods, which at times were 1 to 2C higher. Moreover it is important to note that during both of the past temperature maxima of 1000 and 2000 years ago, the CO2 values were at 280 ppm while today they are at 400 ppm. This indicates that the earlier warmer periods likely were related to natural solar activity and not to a rise in CO2 because there was no CO2 rise during those warm phases.
1 Yes, climate really does change. It was likely just as warm during the Roman warm period 2,000 years ago . . . followed by the Medieval warm period 1,000 years later. Global mean temperatures have since been rising in fits and starts since the little ice age ended about 150 years ago. Overall, this amounts to about 1.5 F since the mid-1800s averaging about 0.1 F per decade. Recent increases have been less than half of the rate predicted by more than 100 IPCC computer models.
1 As Ryan Maue responded, the IPCC might have better expressed this as "we have high confidence that natural variability dominates any AGW influence in observed/historical TC records". Pielke continues...
1 He told WND that weather does change over time and that the global system goes through cycles, some slightly warmer and some slightly cooler than others.
1 Anyone who has followed my posts over the past 4 years about the natural warming of satellite-era sea surface temperatures understands there is nothing in the data to indicate that manmade greenhouse gases played any part in the warming. That is, the data indicates Mother Nature, not manmade greenhouse gases, was responsible for the warming over the past 31 years. The same holds true for ocean heat content data.
1 But then something happened. The climate swang back the other direction (like it always does.) This was not a CO2 driven monotonic trend, but rather a cycle.
1 As I have often stated, this is an interglacial period, ice is supposed to melt. Otherwise there would still be a mile of ice on top of New York City. But despite evidence to the contrary, warmists continue to claim that glaciers are disappearing at an alarming rate.
1 The simple truth is that the world is driven by the sun and the climate has natural cyclical oscillations longer than our memories. Some run out to about 1500 years, and there is even evidence for a 5000 year cycle. When we define climate as 30 year average of weather, we are simply fooling ourselves that our puny lifespan matters.
1 Isotope data from Greenland ice cores and historic atmospheric and oceanic temperature records show a consistent pattern of fluctuating 25-30year warm and cool periods over the past 500 years. During the past century, five of these climate fluctuations can be tied to glacial oscillations, oceanic temperature changes, atmospheric temperature changes, and solar variation.
1 "In the absence of a convincing explanation for warming since the mid 19th century, as well as the multi-decade hiatus periods, I find the extremely likely confidence level to be logically insupportable." "JC message to Gavin Schmidt (as per our discussion on Dan Kahans blog): No I am not making things up re the 50-50 attribution argument. I regard it as a fundamental flaw in logic to infer high confidence in attribution since 1950, without understanding the warming in the early part of the 20th century and the mid century hiatus."
1 It also points out an essential feature of most credible thermometer records that cover many decades. Our climate is highly cyclical , driven in fact by ocean and solar cycles, not carbon dioxide.
1 The more logical explanation is that there are natural cycles in cloud cover which cause multi-decadal periods of global warming or global cooling.
1 The sea level in Israel has been rising and falling over the past 2,500 years, with a one-meter difference between the highest and lowest levels, most of the time below the present-day level.
1 Possible extraterrestrial origins of the observed cyclicities and one off major climate events are discussed, and the natural variation of climate is emphasized at all timescales including our modern epoch. The internal oscillation of energy flows through the ocean are well considered and run as a constant theme throughout the work. Concurrently, the atmospheric processes which result from the interaction of these oceanic energy flows and the direct input of solar energy on the diurnal, seasonal and longer timescales weaves a narrative which supports the often unspoken contention that wind is a powerful and poorly understood driver of climate at all timescales.
1 Has some corroborating evidence to suggest that cosmic rays are affecting the climate, with the extent.
1 The American scientists also performed afrequency analysis of the climatic fluctuations and found the characteristic cycles with periods of 1500, 90 and 60 years ( Figure 3 ). Schmidt and his colleagues interpreted the 1500 year cycle as those that Gerard Bond described earlier. The data set also contained the 60-year cycle, which likely mirrored the Atlantic Decadal Cycle.
1 Kamis doesn't think the air above the Pacific Ocean has enough energy to heat such large swaths of ocean by more than the 0.5 degrees Celsius for such a prolonged period. He also thinks these vent gases have a profound impact on our climate that's only now being understood. "The emphasis here is that the ocean is vast and largely unexplored. As such, we are finding more and more vents in the most unlikely of places," Kamis writes in an email. "These vents are very big climate controllers. Not everything can be attributed to the trace gas carbon dioxide."
1 ???The amount of the sun??s energy that reaches the earth??s surface is the main driver of the earth??s temperature. Clouds are one of the least understood aspects of climate change. They can block the sun, but light can also bounce off one cloud into another cloud??s shadow and increase the solar energy hitting earth,?? said PNNL atmospheric scientist Evgueni Kassianov.
1 Following the demise of what has been called the Roman Warm Period, the authors note the existence of three consistently cold events that were centered at approximately 500, 700 and 900 AD, during what is sometimes referred to as the Dark Ages Cold Period. Then, from 1100-1300 AD, they report "the 18 O of Hongyuan peat cellulose increased, consistent with that of Jinchuan peat cellulose and corresponding to the 'Medieval Warm Period'." Finally, they note that "the periods 1370-1400 AD, 1550-1610 AD, 1780-1880 AD recorded three cold events, corresponding to the 'Little Ice Age'." Regarding the origins of these climatic fluctuations, power spectrum analyses of their data revealed periodicities of 79, 88 and 123-127 years, "suggesting," in the words of the authors, "that the main driving force of Hongyuan climate change is from solar activities." What it means
1 Now Piers has a very good record of forecasting the weather. He has been bang on about these cold winters. Like JMW Turner and the Aztecs he thinks we should be paying more attention to the Sun. According to Piers, global temperature depends not on concentrations of CO2 but on the mood of our celestial orb.
1 In my enthusiasm to pitch the importance of being explicit about the role of equilibrium, my email suggested that it could provide a test of which theory is right. If these scientists could show that the temperature gradient of the oceans had reached equilibrium by 1970, or 1986, then their grounds for dismissing a solar explanation for late-20th century warming would be upheld. If equilibrium was not reached, that would support the solar warming theory.
1 Report shows UN admitting solar activity may play significant role in global warming | Fox News
1 This paper discusses the effect of the greenhouse phenomenon and CO2 on global climate and suggests that numerical models that lack adequate knowledge of fundamental related factors cannot be used to extract "sound" conclusions. A very basic demonstration of this is done through a simple comparison between estimates of the forecast for global temperature increase obtained by various independent studies. Observing the global temperature and the CO2 atmospheric concentration though the geological aeons implies no obvious correlation. Physical observation on other planets like Mars and Venus, needing no numerical modeling, demonstrates the effect of the atmospheric-CO2 partial pressure on the temperature of the atmosphere. Moreover the CO2 role as a factor of danger or a benefactor for life is also addressed. On the other hand the role of the sun in the presently observed global warming has been greatly underestimated. Scientific evidence shows that the orbit of the earth and the Milankovitch cycles greatly affect the climate. A discussion follows pointing out the prime role that the sun should have on the earth's climate with regard to solar cycles' activity and irradiance, cosmic rays and cloud formation. The conclusion drawn here is that a natural signal of solar forcing has been mistakenly overlooked for an anthropogenic change, maybe owing to their quite similar effects on climate. For the moment science does not really have a complete and total understanding of the factors affecting the earth's complex climate system and therefore no sound conclusions can be drawn.
1 Secondly, this paper finds strong evidence of a 30-40 year lag between solar activity and temperature response. So what happened ~40 years after the 1960 peak in sunspot activity? Why that just so happens to be when satellite measurements of global temperature peaked with the 1998 El Nino , followed by the "pause" and cooling since.
1 "The long-term increase in solar irradiance is heating both Earth and Mars," he said.
1 Khabibullo Abdusamatov , mathematician and astronomer at Pulkovskaya Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences: Global warming results not from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but from an unusually high level of solar radiation and a lengthy almost throughout the last century growth in its intensityAscribing greenhouse effect properties to the Earths atmosphere is not scientifically substantiatedHeated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion, ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away.
1 The IPCC mentioning the possibility of a GCR link to clouds is important here. Prof Nir Shaviv in his JGR paper on Using the Oceans as a Calorimeter found a large amplification by empirical study. Cloud change is likely to be proportional to solar change because otherwise our solar planetary model wouldnt successfully hindcast a good match to the paleo reconstructions.
1 That is the total global output by humanity. If the prescriptions of the Kyoto Accord were universally implemented they would reduce it by 0.035 per cent. Diligent mathematicians may, if they wish, apply themselves to calculating Scotlands contribution to that minuscule CO2 production, harmless in any case since solar activity is the likeliest cause of cyclical climate change. That is the threat to our existence in response to which Alex Salmond is destroying the landscape of his country and imposing hardship on its people. To the faithful, of course, this is the Great Leap Forward.
1 That actually shows high-temperature excursions in absolute measure is due to the fact that this episode of relative warming is superimposed on a relatively higher level of solar activity than the others, and from that point of view this observation may be a reason for claiming that the present period of global warming is exceptional.
1 In terms of F10.7 flux, Solar Cycle 24 peaked two years ago. The relationship between F10.7 flux and sea level rise indicates that a flux of 100 is the break-over between climate warming and cooling. The flux level has been at about that value for the last three years.
1 The reduction in Arctic sea ice and increase in Antarctic sea ice has happened before and is called the polar see-saw or polar anomaly. (See Svensmarks attached paper.) The polar see-saw occurs during Dansgaard-Oscheger events (also called Bond events). It is now apparent the later 20th century warming was a Bond event. Gerald Bond found evidence of cosmogenic isotope changes at each of a long series of warming followed by cooling events (he has able to track 25 events through current interglacial Holocene and into the last glacial period, at which point he reached the limit of the range of the proxy analysis technique) which indicates a solar magnetic cycle change caused the warming followed by cooling cycle.
1 The first paper to suggest the hypothesis that the sunspot number time-integral is a proxy for a substantial driver of average global temperature change was made public 6/1/2009. The discovery started with application of the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, and the hypothesis that the energy acquired, above or below breakeven (appropriately accounting for energy radiated from the planet), is proportional to the time-integral of sunspot numbers. The derived equation revealed a rapid and sustained global energy rise starting in about 1941. The true average global temperature anomaly change -trend is proportional to global energy change.
1 My interpretation is much more direct. During our solar maximum, we had more UV that raised cloud levels and atmospheric height, leading to warm days. Now that the sun is taking a nap, UV has plunged, the atmosphere shortens, and we get lower clouds with colder days. Dont see any need for a CO2 thesis at all.
1 Well, the word "only" is somewhat cute in comparison with the "mainstream" fashionable ideology. The IPCC said that they saw a 90% probability that "most" of the recent warming was man-made. The present paper would reduce this figure, 90%, to less than 50% because the Sun itself is responsible for 1/2 of the warming and not the whole 50% of the warming could have been caused by CO2 because there are other effects, too.
1 Recall that the CO2 warmists in their half-baked models stubbornlykeep focusing only on total solar irradiance (TSI), which itself varies only about 0.1% over an 11-year cycle (and thus by itself is no real climate driver) and ignore all the other amplification mechanisms. Well, the results of this study, as do dozens of others studies, show you cant do that. Like it or not the sun is a real player. Eventually the CO2 warmists will have to admit this, as anyone with even just an inkling of intuition would do.
1 Indeed, Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) presented persuasive evidence that solar variability is leaving an imprint on climate, especially in the Pacific. According to the report, when researchers look at sea surface temperature data during sunspot peak years, the tropical Pacific shows a pronounced La Nina-like pattern, with a cooling of almost 1o C in the equatorial eastern Pacific. In addition, there are signs of enhanced precipitation in the Pacific ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ) and SPCZ (South Pacific Convergence Zone) as well as above-normal sea-level pressure in the mid-latitude North and South Pacific, correlated with peaks in the sunspot cycle.
1 Abdussamatovs theory is that long-term variations in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth are the main and principal reasons driving and defining the whole mechanism of climatic changes from the global warmings to the Little Ice Ages to the big glacial periods.
1 We hypothesise that Saturn and Jupiter provide the background drumbeat which governs the solar cycle. The modulation of that beat by the other heavy gas giant planets and magnetically active inner planets is the subject of further investigation which has been taking place on this blog and others. We are getting closer to solving the puzzle and being able to predict the future evolution of solar activity levels with a high degree of confidence. That will revolutionise climate science, because once we can confidently predict solar activity, climatologists will rediscover the Sun as an important climate driver. Watch this space.
1 In conclusion, the claim that the global surface temperature record is a fractional random signal fundamentally different from the harmonic nature of the astronomical signals is not supported by the data and careful analysis. The global surface temperature record appears to be made of natural specific oscillations with a likely solar/astronomical origin plus a noncyclical anthropogenic contribution during the last decades. Indeed, because the boundary condition of the climate system is regulated also by astronomical harmonic forcings, the astronomical frequencies need to be part of the climate signal in the same way the tidal oscillations are regulated by soli-lunar harmonics.
1 Some solar scientists claim that 20th century solar activity was merely ??? high ?? without warranting the ???grand maximum?? label, but that is a distinction without a difference. Whether ???high?? or ???grand,?? since we don??t yet understanding all of the ways that living inside the sun??s extended corona might affect global temperature (and there is the rub, that this understanding is still very immature), 80 years of any high level of solar activity could very well account for most or all of the modest warming over this period.
1 In sum, the attempts by warmists to dismiss the role of the Sun in climate change are based upon oversimplified and elementary analyses which conveniently ignore hundreds of peer-reviewed papers finding an increase of solar activity over the 20th century to a solar "Grand Maximum" at the end of the 20th century, solar-driven ocean oscillations -which have profound and lagged effects upon climate, and many other solar amplification mechanisms described in the literature, all of which provide plausible mechanisms and explanations for all or most of the global warming of the 20th century, as well as the current 18-year global warming "pause."
1 The sun has both direct and indirect effects on our climate. Solar activity changes on cycles of 11 years and longer. When the sun is more active it is brighter and a little hotter. More important though are the indirect effects. Ultraviolet radiation increases much more than the brightness and causes increased ozone production, which generates heat in the high atmosphere that works its way down, affecting the weather. Also, an active sun diffuses cosmic rays, which play an important role in nucleation of low clouds, resulting in fewer clouds. In all these ways the sun warms the planet more when it is active. An active sun in the 1930s and again near the end of the last century helped produce the observed warming periods. The current solar cycle is the longest in over 100 years, an unmistakable sign of a cooling sun that historical patterns suggest will stay so for decades.
1 These results agree with the evidence mustered by Hoyt and Schatten and Georgieva, Kirov, and Bianchi for a phase shift circa 1920 in the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures. However, we can suggest, here, that the supposed negative correlation between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures prior to 1920 rests on a misconstrued understanding of the data. As can be seen in Figure 6, the relationship between the change in the warming rate and solar activity is still positive, i.e. the warming rate is peaking near the peaks of solar cycles 10, 12, and 14, but at a much reduced level, indicative of the lower level of solar activity during the period. Indeed, for much of solar cycle 12, and all of solar cycle 14, the warming rate is negative, but the change in the warming rate is still following the level of solar activity, becoming less negative as solar activity increases, and more negative as solar activity decreases. Still, there is a strong suggestion in Figure 6 of a phase shift circa 1920 in which the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures changes dramatically before and after the shift. Before the shift, the lunar period dominates, and the solar period is much weaker. After the shift, the solar period dominates, and the lunar period becomes subordinate.
1 Some of the global warming on other planets (and our blue, not green planet) has been attributed to the Sun and/or nearby cosmic rays. The shared positive sign in most cases is suggestive but I remain an agnostic here. The internal, mostly random planetary variability is still a plausible explanation for all the changes.
1 Henrik Svensmark described how the sun controls the Earths climate through its effect on cloud formation via cosmic rays. His research took years, was rejected by the orthodox, and proved difficult to get published. It now seems to be the most important climatic discovery for years.
1 A recent paper published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestial Physics (74) 2012 87-93 and authored by Souza Echer et al. suggests that solar cycles, to a substantial extent, drive global temperatures, and that likely through amplification mechanisms.
1 Who knew? However, a casual question back in 2000, from a colleague while I was doing post-doctoral work at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Toronto, led to surprising revelations on climate change. My colleague, an astrophysicist, asked me how cosmic rays from supernovae could affect life on earth, which led me to explore this area of study. I found that the sun's variability as well as unrelated cosmic ray variations, explain a surprisingly large amount of the observed climate variations, from the 11-year solar cycle to geological time scales. In fact, models including the real effect of the sun also do a much better job in explaining 20th century global warming than those limited to the influence of human carbon dioxide emissions alone. h/t Kevin B
1 1) Empirical Solar / CRF / Cloud Cover correlation: In principle, correlations between CRF variations and climate does not necessarily prove causality. However, the correlations include telltale signatures of the CRF-climate link, thus pointing to a causal link. In particular, the cloud cover variations exhibit the same 22-year asymmetry that the CRF has, but no other solar activity proxy (Fichtner et al., 2006 and refs. therein). Second, the cloud cover variations have the same latitudinal dependence as the CRF variations (Usoskin et al. 2004). Third, daily variations in the CRF, and which are mostly independent of the large scale activity in the sun appear to correlated with cloud variations as well (Harrison and Stephenson, 2006).
1 Solar activity has also been shown to be a driver of Pacific ocean oscillations. Thus, these may be additional solar amplification mechanisms whereby small changes in solar activity are amplified via monsoonal and ocean oscillations to have large effects upon climate.
1 We know that the Antarctic Peninsula (advertised as the fastest warming place on the planet) is a volcanic chain which has seen recent activity .
1 There is much more to El Nio event than a simple warming of the eastern tropical Pacific. They have strong impacts on weather around the globe. A strong El Nio event can also cause an upward shift in the temperatures of two-thirds of the surface of the global oceans, while having no apparent long-term effect on the other one-third. Those upward shifts in surface temperatures give the appearance of a relatively steady rise in global surface temperatures when the data are looked at globally. As a result, the rise in global surface temperatures have been incorrectly attributed to human-induced global warming. That means the climate science community is no closer to finding evidence of the human fingerprint in global warming than they were in the early 1990s, the early years of the IPCC. The IPCC has no one to blame for that than themselves, with their focus on carbon dioxide.
1 The warmer interlude in the 1940s and 50s, and again since 1990, are well correlated with the warm phases of the AMO. Based on previous cycles, we may have another decade to go before the AMO returns to its cold phase. And as NOAA point out, it has been around for at least 1000 years, so it wont be going away tomorrow!
1 The hypothesis of manmade global warming depends on manmade greenhouse gases being the cause of the recent warming. But the satellite-era sea surface temperature record indicates El Nio and La Nia events are responsible for the warming of global sea surface temperature anomalies over the past 31 years, not manmade greenhouse gases. And ocean heat content data since 1955 indicate the tropical oceans warmed naturally to depths of 700 meters in response to La Nia events. Ive searched sea surface temperature records for more than 4 years and the ocean heat content records for more than 3 years, and I can find no evidence of an anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in those two datasets. That is, the warming of the global oceans has been caused by Mother Nature, not anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
1 There was a warming between 1977 and 1999 that coincides with the warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The oceans are major drivers of climate, particularly the Pacific, because it covers 35% of the earth??s surface. When it warms, the climate also warms: The atmosphere, the air, is heated from below, the temperatures are higher near the surface.
1 It is beyond my comprehension why anyone would seek to force fit an alternative explanation based on CO2 since 1975/particulates from 1940-1970/solar forcing before 1940 etc. when the ENSO explanation explains the temperature trend extremely well and much more elegantly.
1 3. And ENSO, changes in Sea Level Pressure, and the AMO/AMOC are major contributors to the rise in North Atlantic Ocean Heat Content.
1 Global warming and cooling have closely followed the phases of the PDO. The most significant pattern of PDO behavior is a shift between warm and cool phases that last 20 to 30 years. In 1905, the PDO shifted to its warm phase. In 1946, the PDO changed to its cool phase. In 1977, the PDO returned to its warm phase and produced the current warming. In 2007-8, the PDO turned cold again, so we can expect several decades of naturally-caused global cooling.
1 Hmm, Ill have to go back and update the ENSO Dominates NODC Ocean Heat Content (0-700 Meters) Data post to make sure the ENSO-induced step changes are still there and verify the North Atlantic Ocean Heat Content (0-700 Meters) Is Governed By Natural Variables hasnt changed, too.
1 The whole CO2 argument is tiresome and absurd.The unmoved mover is the sun. The system below responds to the variations in the sun with alag. The warming was because when the oceanswent into their warm cycle (remember there is far greater energy in warm water than in cold dry air), the natural response had to be a warming in the north where there is more land- because equatorialocean warming increases the transport of warm humid air northward. That air has to then warm areas where there is dry air. Ifyou dry out warm humid air,then you warm the airtemperature if the wet bulb is constant. So there is warming over the continents, BUT IT ONLY CONTINUES UNTIL THE OCEANS HAVE ADDED THEIR INPUT. The leveling off of temps is completely consistent with an atmosphere that has absorbed the heat from the warming cycles of the oceans that occurred in tandem from 1995-2007 (warm PDO was 1978-2007, warm AMO 1995 till present, but it will shift).
1 When the impossible has been eliminated, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. The culprit is plainly not atmospheric, not extra-terrestrial, not land-based, but oceanic.
1 Not only do these cycles profoundly influence North American climate, there is considerable evidence that they are partly responsible for that popular hobgoblin, "global warming".
1 Again this is simply saying there is a natural large-scale thermostat called the ocean. The warmer the ocean, the more it drives the whole climate system.
1 The new record captures climate variability in this globally important region and suggests that the warming observed here since the 1950s is not the largest in the past 300 years.
1 According to the authors, "the significance of this record is that it suggests almost half of the warming occurred prior to 1900, before the dramatic buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases." Hence, if something other than greenhouse gases caused the first half of the most recent global warming event (in which we are still imbedded), something other than greenhouse gases may be responsible for the second half of the warming as well.
1 A larger point is that the current warming is not unusual. Even greater warming has occurred many times in the last 11,000 years. It has been as much as two degrees warmer than now three times in the last 10,000 years. More important, warming episodes are followed by cooling episodes that can be disastrous for mankind. The long-term trend for the last 3000 years of the Holocene has been cooling. We are slowly sliding into the next long cold at about half a degree C per millennium.
1 Of the 102 studies that looked at the twentieth century temperature record to determine whether it showed unusually extreme warming, only 3 concluded that it did. Sixteen produced equivocal results, and 79 identified fifty-year-long periods of time that were warmer than any equivalent period in the century, suggesting that recent warming is not particularly unusual.
1 So the Spitzbergen warming the trough to peak warming of 1917 to 1934 may have been more rapid and greater than in magnitude that the similar warming from 1976 to 2006. But from the adjusted data one gets the opposite conclusion.
1 This refutes the government claim that recent warming (which occurred when man-made CO2 was rising) was notably different from an era when man-made CO2 was not claimed to be a factor.
1 Both the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were major climatic events, notwithstanding the attempt of a number of climate alarmists to reduce them to such insignificance that they do not even appear on the temperature history of the world over the past thousand years (see our Editorials of 15 June , 1 July , 15 July and 2 August 2000). Why do the climate alarmists do this? Because they want to promote the idea that the world is currently experiencing unprecedented warming due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2 . As the results of this study clearly show, however, whatever warming may have occurred over the past century or so may be easily nothing more than a return to more normal conditions from the global chill of the Little Ice Age.
1 In the case of the Younger Dryas, average temperatures based on the Greenland ice plummeted as much as 15 degrees Celsius in a few centuries, and then shot back up nearly as much (over just decades) about 1,000 years later.
1 So, this data confirms Obamas assertion that the Exit Glacier has retreated 1.25 miles in the last 200 years. But it also makes it quite clear that it was retreating as fast, or faster, 100 years ago.
1 Our climate is constantly changing for perfectly natural reasons that have nothing to do with carbon dioxide.
1 There is nothing unusual, unnatural or unprecedented about either the timing or the degree of warming experienced by the northern Tibetan Plateau over the past century or so?? Read More
1 On shorter time-scales, temperatures rose in the early part of the 20th century with little or no man-made emissions of CO2.
1 After some reversion to colder and wetter climates in the next 300-400 years, sharply renewed warming from about 800 AD led to an important warm epoch.
1 One does not have to be a climate "rocket" scientist to recognize that the earlier 20th century warming increase was greater than the modern warming. And it is painfully clear, even to proponents of this myth, that the earlier warming increase took place while the CO2 level change was a fraction of that during the modern 50-year period ending in 2013.
1 FV: The temperature increase since 1850 is nothing unusual. Such changes have occurred time and again in history.
1 And at their subsequent advanced positions probably around 500 BC as well as between 1650 and 1850 AD the glaciers in the Alps regained an extent, estimated in the Glockner region, at about 5 times their Bronze Age Minimum, when all the smaller ones had disappeared.
1 Again, the recent era on the right side of the picture has no chance to compete with the late 17th and early 18th century: the 1960-2009 period with the +2.65 C per century ends up outside the top ten. The winner is 1688-1737 with the trend +3.83 C per century. The fastest cooling was in 1722-1771, by -1.69 C per century. These 50-year trends can??t quite be extrapolated to a century, either. But they??re much closer to that than the 10-year or 15-year trends.
1 So basically, all that the global warming advocates really have, as the evidentiary basis for their theory, is that global temperatures were a little higher than usual in the late 1990s. Thats it. Which proves nothing. The climate varies, just as weather varies, and as far as we can tell, this is all well within the normal range.
1 So climate changes abruptly, rapidly, and all on its own. No CO2 needed. It can, does, and has, rapidly warmed. Im not going to quote the whole paper at you. Just a couple of cherry picked points about the fact that some places, during some of this time, were warmer than today . At least, per the beetles. Now if it can warm up to warmer than now in some places, all on its own, and without any CO2 from humans, seems to me it could be doing that right now all on its own too.
1 It is interesting to see on the first Icelandic Met graph that the warming trend has been pretty consistent since 1800, albeit with ups and downs. No sign of any accelerating trend there.
1 A subsequent post by Tony Brown entitled Historic variations in Arctic sea ice Part II: 1920-1950 provided anecdotal historical evidence of Arctic warmth during this period.
1 A large team of scientists making a comprehensive study of data from tree rings say that in fact global temperatures have been on a falling trend for the past 2,000 years and they have often been noticeably higher than they are today despite the absence of any significant amounts of human-released carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back then.
1 It is also clear that the climate of the Earth's polar regions are linked. Intensification of atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (indicated by a stronger Siberian High and northern circumpolar circumpolar westerlies and a deeper Icelandic Low) and to a lesser degree in the Southern Hemisphere (stronger circumpolar westerlies and deeper Amundsen Sea Low) occurs 8200 8400 years ago. Date from Siple Dome (West Antarctica) and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project ice core climate proxies for northern and southern circumpolar westerlies show remarkably concurrent major intensification periods between 6000 and 5000 years ago and starting 1200 600 years ago. It appears that Antarctic events start earlier and less abruptly than those in Greenland.
1 These colossal global catastrophes of the past, and the certainty that similar catastrophes will occur again in the future, maybe even in our lifetime, really puts the feeble temperature wobbles which are ascribed to humans into perspective.
1 Lovejoy??s 99% solution fails to quantify or even accurately describe the patterns of natural variability of the Late Holocene climate. Therefore, his conclusion that the warming since 1880 (~0.4 C per century) cannot be natural is unsupported in his analysis. While it is possible that up.to half of the industrial era warming might be due to the rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, this is hardly conclusive and certainly not at 95% confidence, much less 99%. Davis and Bohling demonstrated that 140-yr runs of 0.4 C per century runs of warming and cooling were not unusual in the GISP2 ice core. The fact that the industrial era slope is roughly twice the norm of the past 2,000 years does not prove that it is of anthropogenic origin. The Little Ice Age was quite possibly the coldest phase of the Holocene since the 8.2 KYA Cooling Event. The LIA was characterized by maximum glacial advances and the most extensive sea ice coverage since the onset of the Neoglaciation (end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum).
1 For instance, after the humorous graph, Spencer showed one that revealed that nearly every century since Roman times has experienced either global warming or global cooling proving that the "norm" is wild change and not some grand mean leveling. The graph also shows that the Roman and Medieval warm periods were just as warm as today's temps.
1 Over and over, you heard testimony from your panelists concerning the deteriorating state of the Arctic and its ecosystems, including its human inhabitants. Over and over you heard about how these systems got to be in their current conditiondecades of warming presumably caused by worldwide reliance on fossil fuels as an energy source. No one told you that conditions in the Arctic were nearly as warm, as warm, or warmer, than they are now a mere 60 years ago. Therefore, if Arctic systems are presently struggling more so than in the past, it points to factors other than anthropogenic climate change as the root cause. Below is an international list of scientists whose published work indicates that the current Arctic warmth is of the same approximate magnitude as that of the 1930s and 1940s.
1 The study published online this week in Nature Geosience (06/05/2012) reports the climatic change that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Roman Iron Age and demonstrates that especially the so-called Grand Minima of solar activity can affect climate conditions in western Europe through changes in regional atmospheric circulation pattern. Around 2800 years ago, one of these Grand Solar Minima, the Homeric Minimum, caused a distinct climatic change in less than a decade in Western Europe.
1 Oh, and as far as that ???modern record?? stuff goes, that??s sneaky stuff too. As I pointed out, and as this graph shows , it was much warmer in the medieval warming period ??? you know, back when those Viking ships were pumping CO2 in the atmosphere and when the Carolingian empire got most of its power from coal-fired power plants.
1 As indicated in the figure below, this undertaking revealed that the mean annual SSTs of the 80-year periods centered on AD 990 (MCA) and AD 50 (RWP) were 0.8??C and 1.4??C higher than the mean SST during the AD 1994-2005 portion of the Current Warm Period (CWP). Likewise, they also report that the mean summer SSTs of the MCA and RWP were, respectively, 0.2 and 1.0??C higher than that of the CWP, while the mean winter SSTs of the MCA and RWP were, respectively, 1.3 and 1.8??C higher than that of the CWP.
1 While acknowledging the existence of the cold, chaotic periods, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has barely factored them into its computer models. The IPCC seems to think it is just coincidence that our warm and relatively stable Modern Warming directly followed the latest awful Little Ice Age.
1 Proxies from all over the world have shown that global climate was as warm or even warmer during the so-called Medieval Warm Period back around a thousand years. Its not called a warm period for nothing!
1 This actual climate evidence is corroborated by the empirical ice core dataset from Greenland. As the ice core empirical evidence depicts , the ancient periods of the Minoans, Romans and the Medieval era were warmer than the present.
1 A scientist from Stockholm University concludes, "The pattern of frequent and rapid changes in climate throughout the Holocene indicates that the warming of the last 100 years is not a unique event and is thus not an indication of human impact on the climate, as is frequently claimed."
1 The researchers collected pollen spores from sediment cores taken from a lake (referred to as JR01 in Figure 2) in Nunavut. They made the appropriate measurements and statistical analyses to link the pollen pattern through time to variations in local temperatures. Surprisingly (to some) they find Reconstructed mean July temperatures remained around 6.6 C before 5700 cal yr BP. July temperatures then increased to 7.8C between 5700 and 3800 cal yr BP and temperatures have decreased slightly during the past 3800 yr and Maximum estimated July temperatures were reached between 5800 and 3000 cal yr BP, at which time they exceeded present-day values. Finally Reconstructions of July temperature using the modern analog technique showed that the mid-Holocene (58002800 cal yr BP) was approximately 1C higher than during the past 1000 yr. See Figure 3, for their temperature reconstruction.
1 See also my other posts on the Medieval Warm Period , and Little Ice Age . If anyone tries to claim the Warmth in Greenland 1000 years ago was a local phenomenon, look at this assembly of hundreds of studies from every continent (bar Australia) showing that it was warmer all over the globe, and that the hockey stick is a minor flawed set of studies in disagreement with most of the data.
1 This brings us to the Number of The Week: 86.7% . As TWTW reported last week, Professor Emeritus of Geology Don Easterbrook has given the annual temperature reports in a different frame of reference. Based on his calculations from the GRIP-2 ice cores from Greenland, for 9,100 of the past 10,500 years it was warmer than today. That is, 86.7% of the time during this 10,500 year period it was warmer than today, and 13.3% of the time it was colder (at least in Greenland).
1 In conclusion, the results of these several studies demonstrate that the so-called unprecedented warmth of the late 20th century is simply a myth, as far as China is concerned. The apparent great warmth of this period in this particular part of the world appears to have been but a common manifestation of naturally-induced and regularly-recurring conditions similar to those that have been experienced in prior millennia. These results also serve as a testimony against those who would deny the existence of an extensive (hemispheric or global) Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, as well as an extensive Roman Warm Period and Dark Ages Cold Period, and cyclical climate changes in general. Clearly, it's time for everyone to wake up! ... and to recognize the dynamic nature of real-world climate change!
1 From CO2 Science , another peer reviewed paper with a paleoclimatology reconstruction based on cores containing plankton shells, show that both the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) can be seen in Indonesia. In the past, critics have said these events to be ???regional?? implying they occurred only around Europe, due to lack of historical records in other regions of the world.
1 The ACWT record, to quote the authors, reveals the existence of "two distinct warm periods from the late 1920s to 1950s and in the late 1980s-90s and two cold periods, one at the beginning of the record (until the 1920s) and another in the 1960s-70s." The SAT record depicts essentially the same thing, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period being not quite as high as the peak temperature of the former warm period. In the case of the ACWT record, this relationship is reversed, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period slightly exceeding the peak temperature of the former warm period; however, the most recent maximum temperature is very short-lived and rapidly declines to hover around a value that is about 1C cooler over the last few years of the record. What it means
1 These 20 studies confirm that the known Northern Hemisphere natural climate change periods, referred to as the Little Ice Age , the Medieval Warming , the Dark Ages and the Roman Period , also had significant impacts on the Southern Hemisphere.
1 The spatio-temporal pattern of peak Holocene warmth (Holocene thermal maximum, HTM) is traced over 140 sites across the Western Hemisphere of the Arctic (0180W; north of ~60N). Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6 +- 0.8 deg C higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 1210 ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada
1 The fallacy in this logic is of course that when energy is lost it has a cooling effect not a warming effect. But the AGW logic has flipped reality upside-down so that atmospheric warming is caused by the energy being lost to space which is really in actual fact, cooling.
1 Answer: Almost certainly nothing , for the same reasons as above, and also since CO2 is unlikely to be revealed as the main driver (or even one of the main drivers) of global warming.
1 Whether the ice caps are melting and whether this is due to global warming or not is not the issue. The issue is whether it is something we can prevent and simply it is not. I have yet to be convinced that CO2 warming effect is significant enough to be responsible for the temperature rises alarmist automatically attribute, without any scientific proof, to CO2, and particularly anthropogenic CO2 emissions. If it is any other reasons to the alarmists presumptions of CO2, then the solution to the global warming problem changes from one of prevention to remedial action. However, thanks to the alarmist everyone is now looking at the wrong solution to the problem.
1 Despite an estimated spend of well over $100-billion since 1990 looking for a human global temperature signal, assessed against geological reality no compelling empirical evidence yet exists for a measurable, let alone worrisome, human impact on global temperature.
1 The final question that arises is what prediction has the AGW made that has been demonstrated, and that strongly supports the theory. It appears that there is NO real supporting evidence and much disagreeing evidence for the AGW theory as proposed. That is not to say there is no effect from Human activity. Clearly human pollution (not greenhouse gases) is a problem. There is also almost surely some contribution to the present temperature from the increase in CO 2 and CH 4 , but it seems to be small and not a driver of future climate. Any reasonable scientific analysis must conclude the basic theory wrong!!
1 However, these two increases did not take place together. Much of the observed temperature rise of 0.5 C occurred before 1940, whereas most of the additional carbon dioxide (over 80%) entered the atmosphere after 1940. Increased greenhouse gases cannot explain a temperature rise that occurred before the major increases in these gases existed in the atmosphere.
1 We find that there is no requirement to invoke greenhouse gas driven mechanisms to explain the temperature changes that are recorded in the ice core record. Instead, we show that changes in the reflection/absorption of sunlight by atmospheric dust are plausible in both an historical sense, by correlation, and in terms of the basic physics of radiative transfer.
1 Is not evidence about what causes global warming. Proof that global warming occurred is not proof that CO2 was mainly responsible.
1 There is no evidence that carbon dioxide has caused global warming, or causes damage to
1 The world has spent $50 billion on global warming since 1990, and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming. Evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time that support the idea that carbon emissions cause global warming.
1 Therefore, even some of those scientists Lord Monckton relies upon agree with PSI that any increase in CO2 actually cools the atmosphere contrary to the some warming assertion his lordship monotonously repeats.
1 CO2 is not climate-relevant; from ground-based measurements, climate change and warming cannot be shown to be caused by increasing Co2 .
1 Geoscience professors Dr. Ole Humlum and Dr. Jan-Erik Solheim have described a simple, empircal harmonic climate model that accurately explains global temperature observations since 1850, without incorporating any forcing from man-made CO2 or aerosols. According to the authors, " What puzzles many is that this model does not have contributions from CO2 and aerosols." " I f we'd had a warming due to CO2, this should appear as a deviation from the simple harmonic model since 1950.There are no signs of any additional heating due to CO2 as the IPCC claims in their reports, thus the assumed CO2 effects in IPCC climate models are exaggerated.The net effect of CO2 is thus so modest that it can not be seen in this data."
1 The Greenhouse Gas Theory (GHGT) which please know, is nothing but a theory was invented 200 years ago and repudiated 100 years ago.
1 Even more important is the mathematical and observational proof that the effect of CO2 on climate is effectively nil.
1 On the overlapping absorption spectral bands of carbon dioxide and water vapor, the carbon dioxide propitiates a decrease of the total emissivity/absorptivity of the mixture in the atmosphere, not an increase, as AGW proponents argue1, 2, 3.
1 Conversely, our understanding that human greenhouse gas emissions are driving global temperatures has a proverbial mountain of supporting evidence. Too bad that every single "line of evidence" that Dana1981 has offered was a negative one.
1 Even so, CO2 constitutes a mere 0.04% of the atmosphere. There is no evidence CO2 plays any role in the Earth?s global temperature.
1 7) Is Increasing CO2 Even Capable of Causing Warming? There are some very intelligent people out there who claim that adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere cant cause warming anyway. They claim things like, the atmospheric CO2 absorption bands are already saturated, or something else very technical. . While it is true that most of the CO2-caused warming in the atmosphere was there before humans ever started burning coal and driving SUVs, this is all taken into account by computerized climate models that predict global warming. Adding more should cause warming, with the magnitude of that warming being the real question. But Im still open to the possibility that a major error has been made on this fundamental point. Stranger things have happened in science before.
1 As per my article this week , forty years ago the space agency, NASA, proved there was no such thing as a greenhouse gas effect because the blackbody numbers supporting the theory didnt add up in a 3-dimensional universe:
1 As more and more scrutiny is applied to the world-wide climate scientists data, methods, peer-review system, and agenda, it is apparent that there is no cause for alarm over CO2 emissions, or any other so-called greenhouse gas emissions. The entire basis for CO2 causing the Earth to warm catastrophically is false. There are cities in California that show a pronounced cooling even while CO2 continues to rise Eureka, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento. San Francisco shows a gradual increase in temperature that corresponds to population growth, but not to CO2 in the atmosphere. see this.
1 Surface Radiation: I set this in accordance with the NASA 2011 energy budget since the other two energy budgets hugely exaggerate this to accommodate their huge back radiation values. I showed in my analysis in the paper Infrared-Absorbing Gases and the Earth's Surface Temperature that there was an upper bound of 5.8% on the amount of back radiation incident on the surface. This was without even invoking the fact that heat flows from warm to cool surfaces and conditions when the air is warmer than the surface other than within a very few tens of meters are infrequent. Because I set the back radiation warming at an estimated value of 1%, the Surface Radiation is (51 + 1 - 7 - 24)% = 21%.
1 The last result does not look obviously compatible with the theory that world-wide warming has been caused by CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases. If that were true, the intra-seasonal correlations would be higher, as CO2 concentration has a strong seasonal component: instead, they are generally even lower than the link between, say, Winter temperatures to Spring temperatures.
1 1. Convection accounts for approximately 67% of the total amount of heat transfer from the Earth's surface to the troposphere, the condensation of water vapour for 25% and radiation accounts for only 8%. As the heat transfer in the troposphere occurs mostly by convection, accumulation of CO2 in the troposphere intensifies the convective process of heat and mass transfer, because of the intense absorption of infrared radiation, and leads to subsequent cooling and not warming as commonly believed.
1 our rejection of AGW is not absolute; it might be a false positive, and we cannot rule out the possibility that recent global warming has an anthropogenic footprint. However, this possibility is very small, and is not statistically significant at conventional levels.
1 You can wrap a heat source with as much insulation as you want. All that will happen is that the insulation will reach the temperature of the heat source, and the heat source willnot rise in temperature. Insulation is just matter, just material like anything else. When exposed to heat, it will warm, and will conduct that heat outward via diffusion.
1 In the stratospherethe absorption of sunlight by the plentiful ozone trace gas is the main source of heat. Naturally the absorbed radiative energy must be given off once again. In the stratosphere this occursfor the most part through heat radiation into space by CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2in the atmosphere has a cooling effect, ozone a warming effect!
1 What happens to an air parcel when a CO 2 molecule absorbs an IR photon? Since the molecule can only exist in specific discrete energy states it jumps to a higher (excited) energy state. However in this process the translational energy of the CO 2 molecule does not change. The average speed of the molecules of the air parcel containing this CO 2 molecule has not increased. Since temperature is related to the root mean square speed of the molecules the temperature of the air parcel does not increase. CO 2 does not trap heat.
1 Yet all the while Hertzberg, Latour, Postma, Kleespies and other non-partisan scientists are telling us is that there is no such thing as a Greenhouse Effect. If you study their writings you will see how they openly address the complexities within the physics and thermodynamics to show that our planets surface temperature can be explained without the chicanery concocted behind closed doors. We can see that there is no need to postulate an additional radiative GHE, and that the entire concept is based on a misinterpretation and an incorrect comparison of physical metrics.
1 Early Earth stayed warm because its ocean absorbed more sunlight; greenhouse gases were not involved, Stanford researchers say. See more about the Faint sun paradox here . A video clip follows.
1 (6) EVUETIPTCTHODTEOAPTs might conclude that the small increase in the level of the atmospheric trace gas CO2 is known by mankind to be harmful to the Earth??s environment,
1 This is the so-called logarithmic effectadding more and more CO2 has a progressively weaker radiative forcing response.
1 IN recent years, a major advance in our understanding of the physical dynamics of the climate process has come from the work of Ferenc Miskolczi. For the present note I am calling his discovery the climatically saturated greenhouse effect. I use these words to mean that the saturation of which I speak is not the classical static saturation of an isolated system, but is saturation in a specially extended sense for an open system in a thermodynamically-non-equilibrium dynamic steady state.
1 2. Closer examination of the last century using better data shows that from 1940 to 1975 the earth cooled at about 0.1C/decade while atmospheric carbon increased. But any warming effect of atmospheric carbon is immediate. By 2003 or so we had discovered global dimming, which might be adequate to explain this 35-year non-correlation. But what had seemed like a good fit between recent atmospheric carbon and global warming now looks shaky, in need of the recently-discovered unquantified global dimming factor to explain 35 years of substantial cooling. I reckon the last century of correlation evidence now neither supports carbon emissions as the cause nor eliminates it. Further quantitative research on global dimming might rescue this bit of evidence, or it might weaken it further.
1 4.They claimed an increase in CO2 causes an increase in temperature. Every single record of any duration for any time period shows the opposite. Temperature increases before CO2. It is not driving temperature or climate change.
1 Of the two periods of global warming this century, the first, and warmest, occurred before rise in carbon dioxide;
1 In every record, temperature increases before CO2. In other words, CO2 is not causing temperature increases, contradicting the basic assumption of the entire anthropogenic global warming hypothesis.
1 With that in mind, in early 2009, we started carefully studying the science behind the man-made global warming theory, and analysing the data for ourselves. Our research has revealed that increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in atmosphere does not cause global warming.
1 If carbon emissions rise faster than anyone predicted, but the rise in global air temperatures is about 90percentless than expected, and if we are told that we should be seeing more droughts whereas there is actually a decrease, then so-called scientific forecasts about carbon dioxide emissions are woefully wrong.
1 The most obvious reason is that CO2 lags temperature. Changes in ocean temperature have driven the changes in atmospheric CO2, as explained here . CO2 is not the driver.
1 The temperature increases or decreases come first, and it is only after 500-1500 years that the CO2 follows. Fig 3 shows the data from the termination of the last Glacial Cooling (Major Glaciation) that ended some 15,000 20,000 years ago through the current Interglacial Warming of today. The four instances where the temperature changes precede the CO2 curve are clearly shown. All the Vostok data going back some 420,000 years show exactly the same behavior. Any objective scientist looking at that data would conclude that it is the warming that is causing the CO2 increases, not the other way around as Gore claimed. I am indebted to Guy Leblanc Smith ( guy.lbs@rockknowledge.com.au ) for granting permission to use Fig. 3 as it was published in Viv Forbes web-site www.carbon-sense.com .
1 Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature.
1 Ghostly artistic images of water vapor using data from the Aqua satellite's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder. NASA. Without such a theory it is impossible to predict changes in atmospheric circulation, it is impossible to predict changes in the hydrological cycle, it is impossible to predict storm frequencies, intensities and tracks. Future climate cannot be predicted without a theory explaining how climate works, yet the IPCC has confidently made predictions regarding changes in storms, precipitation and climate for decades, even centuries into the future. If something as seemingly simple as water vapor can have such complex and bewildering impacts on Earth's climate why does the IPCC and the climate crisis crowd continue to insist that all fault lies with CO 2 ? It could be that even they realize that blaming global warming on water vapor would give them no political leverage. After all, 70% of our planet's surface is covered with water and not even the most wild-eyed geoengineering proponent would propose we attempt to control the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.
1 Like water vapour, carbon dioxide also absorbs some incident Solar radiation, particularly in the 2.7 micron band. So it prevents this radiation from reaching and warming the surface. However, the atmosphere has only about 0.04% carbon dioxide, compared with about 1% to 4% water vapour. Each water vapour molecule absorbs and radiates in a far wider range of wavelengths than each carbon dioxide molecule and so, as some have estimated, the overall effect of all the carbon dioxide could be as little as 0.1% that of all the water vapour. And that effect is likely to be a net cooling effect anyway.
1 Furthermore, the missing hotspot in the atmospheric warming pattern observed during the last warming period proves that (1) the IPCC climate theory is fundamentally broken, and (2) to the extent that their theory correctly predicts the warming signature of increased carbon dioxide, we know that carbon dioxide definitely did not cause the recent warming (see here for my full explanation of the missing hotspot ). The alarmists keep very quiet about the missing hotspot.
1 In its Endangerment Finding, the EPA produced no physical evidence of the existence of the hotspot. Further, with the divergence of atmospheric data from the surface data, which has been inflated to show a greater warming trend than before, it is doubtful if anyone can show the existence of a pronounced hotspot.
1 Naturally they claim this ancient forest was wiped out by global warming, somehow forgetting to mention that for hundreds of millions of years prior to the Carboniferous age atmospheric carbon dioxide had been somewhere north of 3,000ppm, possibly far north. The later Permian warming occurred when CO 2 was at about its lowest point in at least 300 million years the only other time it is thought to have been as dangerously low as todays meager levels.
4 Dr. Craig Idso , the founder, former president, and current chairman of the board of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, provided a plethora of information on exactly how CO2 affects the environment. Global warming alarmists should be comforted that they have a lot more to be happy about and should not be fretting that global catastrophe is knocking at the door.
2 Life plays a major role in determining the climate of the planet, and has for eons been able to maintain the globe's mean temperature within a range conducive to its continued existence. Peck et al . have illuminated one of the many phenomena that contribute to this grand homeostasis. References
2 Since 0.9 K warming has occurred since 1750 (Central England Temperature Record), the 2 K threshold beyond which we are told a net climate-related cost begins to arise may well not be crossed until the end of this century. A slow rate of warming is less damaging than a rapid rate, so even after 2100 the net disbenefit from the warming may be insignificant.
2 Of course were being told that global warming is bringing clouds closer to the ground, and that Falling clouds could counter global warming.
2 The conclusiontaking the best observational estimates of the change in decadal-average global temperature between 1871-80 and 2002-11, and of the corresponding changes in forcing and ocean heat uptakeis this: A doubling of CO2 will lead to a warming of 1.6-1.7C (2.9-3.1F).
2 However, climate scientists and climate models instead falsely assume that the Kirchhoff, Planck, and Stefan-Boltzmann laws can be applied to greenhouse gases and that they behave as blackbodies. Dr. Robitaille shows prior work from Hottel et al demonstrating that the emissivity of both of these greenhouse gases decrease with temperature , the opposite of the climate science assumption that greenhouse gases increase emissivity and absorptivity with temperature. For conservation of energy, emissivity must equal absorptivity for all materials and gases, therefore increases in temperature decrease both emissions and absorption of infraredradiation by the greenhouse gases water vapor and CO2, i.e. they become less 'greenhouse like' gases as temperatures increase, a self-regulatory mechanism that suggests less climate sensitivity to CO2 with increasing temperature.
2 Two new climate studies have delivered a critical blow to global warming alarmism. Estimates driven by old computer models projected an increase of 1.2 C in global temperature if carbon-dioxide levels double. However, new research relying on available empirical data shows the climate's sensitivity to higher amounts of carbon dioxide is much lower than previously thought as low as 0.02 C if carbon-dioxide levels double. With these modest temperature projections, perhaps the Chicken Little tendencies of climate alarmists will subside. READ MORE
2 What follows is quantitative evidence that suggests why this mix-up between cause and effect causes the illusion of high climate sensitivity. (The paper describing this evidence is under revision to be resubmitted to Journal of Geophysical Research after we address questions raised by the three reviewers of the paper). The causation issue can be illustrated with the following graph of 7.5 years of recent satellite-measured global ocean average variations in tropospheric temperature versus top-of-atmosphere total radiative flux (LW is emitted infrared, SW is reflected sunlight). Both of these datasets are publicly available.
2 The authors findings, as well as those of the other scientists they cite, provide strong support for the negative feedback phenomenon we outline in our Editorial of 10 October 2001 , which describes but one of the many different ways in which earth's biosphere tempers the tendency for global warming produced by man's CO 2 emissions. References
2 The sensitivity atmospheric temperature to CO2 from measured data, is therefore much lower than was predicted and that includes the argo data. Alternatively rather than a CO2 sensitivity misjudgement, all that heat that Dr. Trenberth is famously looking for, very well could be sitting in the deep ocean making too little impact over 100 years to actually measure and all it would take is a tiny bit more (or less) oceanic intermixing than models predict for that huge heatsink to be the true source of measured climate change. It could potentially have overwhelmed the CO2 effect without our knowing.
2 While Dessler and Trenberth (among others) claim clouds have an overall positive feedback warming effect upon climate due to the long-wave back-radiation, this new paper shows that clouds have a large net cooling effect by blocking incoming solar radiation and increasing radiative cooling outside the tropics.
2 Projections v. Reality: On his blog, Roy Spencer presents a comparison of the lower atmospheric temperature trends as projected from 44 climate models and as calculated from satellite observations. John Christy provided the model projections. Spencer used the both the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH) and the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) calculations. The disparity is striking. Since the greenhouse effect takes place in the lower atmosphere, this is further evidence that the planet is not as sensitive carbon dioxide emissions as advocated by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
2 When I looked at historic temperature and CO2 levels, it was impossible for me to see how they could be in any way consistent with the high climate sensitivities that were coming out of the IPCC models. Even if all past warming were attributed to CO2 (a heroic assertion in and of itself) thetemperatureincreases we have seen in the past imply a climate sensitivity closer to 1 rather than 3 or 5 or even 10 (I show this analysis in more depth in this video ).
2 Readers may recall that last December I published an informal climate sensitivity study at Bishop Hill, here . The study adopted a heat-balance (energy budget) approach and used recent data, including satellite-observation-derived aerosol forcing estimates. I would like now to draw attention to a new peer-reviewed climate sensitivity study published as a Letter in Nature Geoscience , "Energy budget constraints on climate response", here . This study uses the same approach as mine, based on changes in global mean temperature, forcing and heat uptake over 100+ year periods, with aerosol forcing adjusted to reflect satellite observations. Headline best estimates of 2.0C for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and 1.3C for the arguably more policy-relevant transient climate response (TCR) are obtained, based on changes to the decade 200009, which provide the best constrained, and probably most reliable, estimates. The 595% uncertainty ranges are 1.23.9C for ECS and 0.92.0C for TCR. I should declare an interest in this study: you will find my name included in the extensive list of authors: Alexander Otto, Friederike E. L. Otto, Olivier Boucher, John Church, Gabi Hegerl, Piers M. Forster, Nathan P. Gillett, Jonathan Gregory, Gregory C. Johnson, Reto Knutti, Nicholas Lewis, Ulrike Lohmann, Jochem Marotzke, Gunnar Myhre, Drew Shindell, Bjorn Stevens, and Myles R. Allen. I am writing this article in my personal capacity, not as a representative of the author team.
2 Finally, if, as Lindzen (2008) has suggested, all terrestrial forcings were cut by two-thirds to take account of the absence of the altitudinal difference in decadal warming rates in the tropics that is predicted in all of the models on which the IPCC relies but has not been observed in half a century of radiosonde observations and 30 years of satellite records (Douglass et al., 2007), climate sensitivity would again decline
2 Now researchers at MIT have found that with the loss of sea ice, the Arctic Ocean is becoming more of a carbon sink. The team modeled changes in Arctic sea ice, temperatures, currents, and flow of carbon from 1996 to 2007, and found that the amount of carbon taken up by the Arctic increased by 1 megaton each year.
2 Truth n 10 The water vapour content of the air has been roughly constant since more than 50 years but the humidity of the upper layers of the troposphere has been decreasing: the IPCC foretold the opposite to assert its ???positive water vapour feedback?? with increasing CO2. The observed ???feedback?? is negative.
2 But if some other forcing is responsible for the temperature change, that necessarily implies lower climate sensitivity. And the greater the unknown forcing involved, the smaller the climate sensitivity you will calculate.
2 August, 2007 RESEARCH UPDATE: Our peer-reviewed paper showing the natural cooling behavior of tropical cirrus clouds in response to warming was published on August 9 in Geophysical Research Letters. (The UAH news release is here. ) In that paper we describe satellite evidence for a natural cooling mechanism (negative feedback)that occurs when the tropical atmosphere heats up. This is in contrast to all leading climate models, which have cirrus clouds behaving as a positive feedback, amplifying warming tendencies.
2 Several negative feedback mechanisms have been proposed by others to explain the stability of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP). If these ocean thermostat mechanisms effectively suppress warming in the future, then coral reefs in this region should be less exposed to conditions that favor coral reef bleaching. In this study we look for regional differences in reef exposure and sensitivity to increasing SSTs by comparing reported coral reef bleaching events with observed and modeled SSTs of the last fifty years. Coral reefs within or near the WPWP have had fewer reported bleaching events relative to reefs in other regions. Analysis of SST data indicate that the warmest parts of the WPWP have warmed less than elsewhere in the tropical oceans, which supports the existence of thermostat mechanisms that act to depress warming beyond certain temperature thresholds.
2 And this is what many have been saying now and for some time, that the climate sensitivity has been overestimated. Kudos to Annan for realizing the likelihood of a lower climate sensitivity.
2 Q: Dr. S. Fred Singer: Perhaps to clarify the discussion. We need to separate these results of model experiments - of course that's all they are are experiments with models, from scenarios of how CO2 will increase. These are two separate issues. As far as I can tell from the IPCC report, their estimate or their numbers for the what is call the "climate sensitivity" that is, how much temperature rise will be produced by doubling of CO2 alone, all other things being equal, has not changed since 1990. It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds. So the climate sensitivity is the one we are interested in. I think many of us believe that these numbers, that the IPCC has given, are just plain wrong.
2 Even more important, the feedbacks (from WV and from clouds) may actually be negative rather than positive (as assumed in all climate models). This possibility follows from the analyses of satellite data .
2 These strong negative cloud feedbacks resulted in a low climate sensitivity of only 0.41 K/(W m-2), described as being at the ???low end?? of traditional GCMS (i.e. around 1.5 deg C/doubled CO2.):
2 Professor Ray Bates gave a paper in Moscow in summer 2015 in which he concluded, based on the analysis by Lindzen & Choi (2009, 2011) (Fig. T10), that temperature feedbacks are net-negative. Accordingly, he supports the conclusion both by Lindzen & Choi (1990) (Fig. T11) and by Spencer & Braswell (2010, 2011) that climate sensitivity is below and perhaps considerably below 1 C per CO2 doubling.
2 Using satellite observations interpreted with a simple model, Spencers data support negative feedback (or cooling) better than they support positive feedback.
2 A team of scientists recently released a report debunking the IPCC prediction that there would be a massive die-off of ocean plankton due to ocean acidification. That??s not happening either.
2 The same can be said of most of the other species on the planet. The Ice Age Megafauna survived the stresses of many Ice Age cycles, until the Upper Paleolithic human hunters came along and added a new stress. The Ice Age Megafauna had evolved and survived in tandem with the Ice Ages, and it doesn't appear likely that "climate change' made them go extinct.
2 This is a heat-loving amoeba. As water temperatures go up, it does better. In future decades, as temperatures rise, wed expect to see more cases.
2 The authors write that "woody species are predicted to increase in tundra ecosystems as a result of global climate change (Chapin et al ., 1996; Epstein et al ., 2000)," and, in fact, it has been found that in response to rising air temperatures, "trees have established where they did not previously occur, both in alpine areas (Wardle and Coleman, 1992; Peterson, 1994; Kullman, 2001, 2002), and in arctic tundra (Lescop-Sinclair and Payette, 1995; Danby and Hik, 2007)," while "increasing shrub abundance also has been reported in alpine (Klanderud and Birks, 2003) and arctic locations (Sturm et al ., 2001; Tape et al ., 2006; Wilson and Nilsson, 2009)."
2 In the words of the eight scientists involved in the study, "the observed association between shrub cover types and increased NDVI is generally consistent with the concept that woody plants can take advantage of warmer conditions and grow more vigorously." Reviewed 28 November 2012
2 So the third claim is not true either. Atolls are created by sea level rise, not destroyed by sea level rise.
2 In discussing the roles of wave exposure, local currents and the presence of large sand islands, the seven scientists state that it is the combination of those factors -- and "not temperature" -- that "is the primary factor influencing biogeographic distributions along the subtropical east coast of Australia." And supporting this conclusion is the contemporaneous study of Seabra et al . (2011) , which describes how it is that intertidal marine species can easily withstand significant climatic warming without having to migrate poleward. Reference
2 A recent paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change , reported in The Australian, showed Zooxanthellae the symbiotic organisms that live inside corals can adapt much better to warming water than was previously thought It is also known corals can, to a degree, change their Zooxanthellae with changing conditions. ( source )
2 (3) Coral tissue thickness, often seen as an indicator of coral health, is generally higher for corals in hotter water. Some of the highest tissue thickness measured have occur around PNG where the water is far hotter than the GBR.
2 Van Woesik et al . write that their findings suggest that the ecosystem they studied was "able to absorb the thermal stressors without undergoing change to a less desirable state," citing the similar findings of Holling (1973) and Scheffer and Carpenter (2003)," as well as the fact that " Acropora populations had fully recovered seven years after an extreme thermal-stress event in Palau (Golbuu et al ., 2007)," plus the fact that in the Arabian Gulf, "Riegl and Purkis (2009) showed that Acropora assemblages could recover from thermal-stress cycles occurring every fifteen years."
2 The results of this study demonstrate that the biosphere can -- and does! -- respond to rapid changes in climate. Indeed, the group of 15 authors state that "the biosphere was a full participant in these rapid fluctuations, contrary to widely held views that vegetation is unable to change with such rapidity." Furthermore, warmer was always better in terms of vegetative productivity. Thus, future warming in this region may return this area to more favorable conditions.
2 Noting that "in summer, 51 of 65 breeding species had negative slopes of mass against year, 20 of 26 wintering species had negative slopes, 60 of 83 spring migrants had negative slopes, and 66 of 75 autumn migrants had negative slopes," Van Buskirk et al . conclude that their results "offer compelling evidence that climate change has already produced observable adaptive shifts in morphology, behavior, and phenology of a great many species," as, we might add, birds do what they need to do to successfully cope with the climate changes they encounter, which according to the world's climate alarmists have been unprecedented over the past one to two millennia. Yes, birds do it ... and they do it fast , and they do it well .
2 Lets also keep in mind that coastal sealife are routinely subjected to dramatically changing conditions including pH, temperature, salinity and turbidity and they survive.
2 In the concluding words of Caruso et al ., "the rapidity and the widespread extent of these changes across so many species in a biodiversity hotspot may signal rapid adaptation to novel environmental conditions."
2 Shock News : Polar Bears Surviving An Ice-Free Hudson Bay
2 Of course this isnt news, as Ive previously reported: Polar Bears Survived the Ice Free Arctic
2 "We see reason for concern, but find no reliable evidence to support the contention that polar bears are currently experiencing a climate crisis," Canadian scientists wrote in their study, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution.
2 ???In the 1950s the polar bear population up north was estimated at 5,000. Today it??s 20- to 25,000, a number that has either held steady over the last 20 years or has risen slightly. In Canada, the manager of wildlife resources for the Nunavut territory of Canada has found that the population there has increased by 25 percent.??
2 Baffin Bay population. The IUCN says that the initial estimate (1984-1989) for this subpopulation was 300 to 600 bears. A second survey (1993 to 1997) estimated this declining population to be 2,074 bears. Please note that the previous two sentences are not the result of some bizarre typo. The extremely low initial numbers were presumably due to a flawed methodology (data collected in the spring in which the capture effort was restricted to shore-fast ice and the floe edge off northeast Baffin Island while recent work has shown that an unknown proportion of the subpopulation is typically offshore during the spring) How can the IUCN confidently conclude that this subpopulation is decreasing? Because the current (2004) estimate based on simulations is that the population is 1,600 bears. The reason for the decline is that the subpopulation appears to be substantially over-harvested. One of the reasons that it is over-harvested is that in 2004 Nunavut increased its hunting quota from 64 to 105 bears per year because reports from Inuit hunters that polar bear numbers in BB had grown substantially. Note that nowhere in this Orwellian story is the decrease in the Baffin Bay polar bear population blamed on receding summer ice due to global warming.
2 Based on many decades of evidence, the Inuit declare it is the time of the most polar bears. In contrast, reports of the polar bear decline have been based on cherry-picked shortterm trends. Here are some longerterm trends to put polar bear population fluctuations into perspective:
2 Polar bear expert Susan Crockford marked the 40th anniversary of an international agreement to protect polar bears by publishing 10 good reasons not to worry about climate change impacts on the Arctic predator.Among the reasons not to be concerned, Crockford notes that only one polar bear subpopulation has had a statistically significant decline in recent years.Another reason, Crockford observed, is sea ice extent during the spring gorging period remains virtually unchanged, with most sea ice decline occuring during the less important late summer.Crockford's full article is available here.
2 Then there is Dr. Susan J. Crockford, an evolutionary biologist in British Columbia, who has studied polar bears for most of her 35-year career. She claims polar bears are threatened by too much ice. Shes released a new, in-depth report on the relationship between sea ice and polar bears, entitled Arctic Fallacybut you dont see her conclusions touted in the New York Times .
2 Also, the bear count did not take into account the fact that polar bears can just move to other areas if their food supply is limited, Crockford told CNSNews.com.If some of those bears were part of that count, it would look like they died.
2 Regarding the models used to predict the future for polar bears, remember that Steven Amstrup, who is now a full time spokesperson for Polar Bears International , was the only polar bear expert consulted about how polar bears might respond to the sea ice changes generated by climate models. As Ive pointed out previously ( here and here ), Amstrup appears to have been wrong, at least as far as his predictions on polar bear responses to declines in summer sea ice (July-September) are concerned.
2 CO2 has been claimed to be the driver for coral reef dies off (and almost every other problem). This report is debunks the theory in the case of Caribbean coral reefs.
2 Hot on the heels of the frogs not being killed off by climate change debacle (see here ), The Australian reports that the barrier reef has the ability to adapt to changes in climate. Why this comes as a shock to anyone is beyond me, given that parts of the reef are millions of years old and would have gone through multiple ice ages, multiple interglacials, multiple climate optima and goodness knows what else, yet its still there.
2 Other peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated that prior claims about ecological effects from ocean acidification have been overblown , increased CO2 dissolution in the oceans increases calcification of shellfish and coral, and that corals evolved at a time when CO2 levels were 15 times higher than the present.
2 the concentration of enough CO2 to significantly reduce the oceans pH will not come from the atmosphere;
2 A paper published today in Biogeosciences finds that prior claims about the effects of ocean "acidification" on c alcifying plankton are highly exaggerated because the artificial laboratory conditions utilized do not correctly simulate the effects in naturalseawater. The authors find exposure of the plankton to "acidific ation" from elevated CO2 concentrations of up to 3247 ppm had no effect on the life cycle (population density, growth and reproduction) of calcifying plankton when natural buffering sediment was present in the experiment.
2 It??s highly unlikely the atmospheric levels of CO2 will reach 1,000 ppm in the next couple of centuries, but if they did, it appears that at least one major and widespread species of cold water coral can adapt within six months. Co2 feeds plant life above the water, and atmospheric levels were much higher during the time that corals evolved. That doesn??t guarantee anything, but suggests scientists could have been more cautious in predicting a disaster when they didn??t have the data.
2 Changing Waters: Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, who has since left, gives four succinct reasons why we should not fear that enhanced CO2 will cause the so-called ocean acidification and it is not a threat to creatures in the oceans: 1) higher concentrations of CO2 in the past; 2) buffering from elements such as calcium and magnesium; 3) biology of mollusks allow them to survive in freshwater that is quite acidic and 4) adding CO2 to saltwater aquariums promotes plant and coral growth. See links under Acidic Waters.
2 First, the ocean seems to becoming slightly less basic not more acidic. Next, the change is happening slow enough that marine life should be able to adapt, through natural selection if necessary. Warmists do believe in evolution, right? Finally, in this experiment, squid eggs were simply hatched in a tank with a 3-time less basic pH level anticipated in 100 years i.e., no chance for natural selection to operate.
2 Writing of corals, the authors say "it has been shown that it is possible for colonies to acclimatize to increased temperatures and high irradiance levels so that they are able to resist bleaching events when they occur." And they note, in this regard, that "threshold temperatures that induce coral bleaching-related mortality vary worldwide -- from 27??C in Easter Island (Wellington et al ., 2001) to 36??C in the Arabian Gulf (Riegl, 1999) -- according to the maximum water temperatures that are normal in the area, implying a capacity of corals and/or zooxanthellae to acclimatize to high temperatures depending on their environment."
2 While eco-alarmists would have you believe the oceans have "acidified" to dangerous pH levels, a paper published in Nature finds that the modern ocean pH of about 8.1-8.2 is actually the most alkaline the oceans have been over the past 250 million years. During this time corals, phytoplankton, and indeed most of the ocean biomass have evolved. The paper shows a mean pH of about 7.7 over the past 250 million years, whereas the alarmist and frequently incorrect IPCC predicts ocean pH will drop to 7.88 (~0.2 pH units) under a "business as usual" scenario by 2100.
2 The effects on calcification rates for all 18 species were either negligible or positive up to 606 ppm CO2. Corals, in particular seemed to like more CO2 in their diets
2 Pia Heinemann reports in Die Welt today, Ocean Acidification Does Not Lead To Species Die-Off ,on a new study appearing in the latest edition of Science. The study contradicts the assumption that ocean acidification leads to species die-off, surprising scientists. Abstract in Science here
2 This is the rst study showing a positive response in calcication to increasing pCO2 for the predominant reef-forming cold-water coral L. pertusa and, to our knowledge, for scleractinian corals in general. **
2 In light of the above-described findings plus their many previous findings that acidity drives divergence in embryonic acid stress tolerance and larval life-history traits (Rasanen et al ., 2003; Hangartner et al ., 2011; Hangartner et al ., 2012a,b), Egea-Serrano et al . feel confident in concluding that their results "provide strong evidence for simultaneous adaptation to acidic pH and increased invertebrate predator pressure in acidified ponds, whereby changes in the abiotic environment (pH) increase strength of selection via biotic interactions (predation)."
2 A paper published today in Global Change Biology finds that prior papers about the alleged effect ofocean acidificationon marine organisms are overblown because prior research has failed to consider that organisms can adapt over time to pH changes. According to the authors, nearly all of this work has focused on the effects of future conditions on modern populations, neglecting the role of adaptation.
2 The ocean acidification story depends only on a chemical hypothesis whereas biological factors can overcome this and create conditions that allow calcification to continue. This is corroborated by the historical record of millions of years of success in much higher CO2 environments.
2 This latter result, although seemingly strange, is anything but unusual; for the nine researchers report that various taxa of coccolithophores and sea urchins "show enhanced calcification in environments with higher pCO 2 ," citing the work of Iglesias-Rodriguez et al . (2008), Doney et al . (2009) and Ries et al . (2009). And they say that "different populations of Emiliania huxleyi have shown decreased, increased, or unchanged calcification in response to higher pCO 2 ," citing Fabry (2008).
2 They also estimate past pH of the oceans to have been more alkaline than now, even though no measurements were made at that time, and then they proclaim the contrivance to be a fact of science. All biology controls pH in extreme ways and has very wide tolerance for pH in environmentswide meaning several pH units, not the tenths being argued. For example, respiration generates ATP by creating a hydrogen ion dam and allowing the escaping protons to turn proteins.
2 Effects of Seawater Acidification on Phytoplankton Growth Rates (22 Feb 2011) Results indicated that marine phytoplankton are resistant to climate change in terms of ocean acidification, and do not increase or decrease their growth rates according to ecological relevant ranges of pH and free CO2" ...

2 The next item is the dangerously acidic oceans. As a chemist, I think dangerously acidic is a strong acid (usually mineral acid) with a concentration that gets the pH below 2. The climate scientists seem to think that dangerously acidic is above 8, which us stupid chemists believe is basic. The article has the standard 26% more acidic, which represents a pH change of about 0.1 unit. Under this definition of more acidic, a decrease in pH from 13 to 12.9 is about an increase in acidity of 26%.
2 The six scientists determined that even following a reduction in seawater pH to 7.4, "the photosynthetic capacity of the symbiosis was preserved." And they say that "this along with the unaffected anemone respiration rates indicated that the metabolic relationship was also preserved."
2 The researchers at Woods Hole have spent four years doing a comprehensive study at Palau Rock Islands in the far Western Pacific, where pH levels are naturally ???more acidic?? (which is big-government speak for less alkaline ). Because of laboratory experiments Barkley et al expected to find all kinds of detrimental effects, but instead found a diverse healthy system they describe as ???thriving?? with ???greater coral cover?? and more ???species??.
2 ???Surprisingly, in Palau where the pH is lowest, we see a coral community that hosts more species, and has greater coral cover than in the sites where pH is normal,?? says Anne Cohen, a co-author on the study and Barkley??s advisor at WHOI. ???That??s not to say the coral community is thriving because of it, rather it is thriving despite the low pH, and we need to understand how.??
2 It is not carbon dioxide from burning coal that pollutes the skies of Asia and Africa. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring, clean, invisible, beneficial gas. CO2 is an essential part of the natural world but a very minor trace constituent of our atmosphere.
2 Carbon dioxide is vital to all life on Earth because no vegetation can exist without it.
2 The two researchers report that "across all studies, parental e CO 2 increased subsequent germination by 9%," and that "despite a considerable interspecific variability," they found "a positive correlation between germination success and seed mass responses to parental e CO 2 ," with the response being "significantly higher in trees than in other life forms." What it means
2 Clearly, elevated O 3 has a number of significant negative impacts on the well-being of North America's most widely distributed tree species, while elevated CO 2 has a number of significant positive impacts. In addition, elevated CO 2 often completely eliminates the negative impacts of elevated O 3 . Hence, if the tropospheric O 3 concentration continues to rise in the future - and it is indeed expected to do so (the authors note that "damaging O 3 concentrations currently occur over 29% of the world's temperate and subpolar forests but are predicted to affect fully 60% by 2100") - we had better hope that the air's CO 2 content continues to rise as well. Without it, we will be in a world of hurt; for the authors report that "since the mid-1990s, aspen use has increased almost exponentially in the US Great Lakes Region and in the boreal mixed wood region of Canada, where the resource is now almost fully utilized."
2 Jin et al . write that the bioavailability of iron to terrestrial plants "is often limited (Guerinot and Yi, 1994), particularly in calcareous soils, which represent 30% of the earth's surface (Imsande, 1998)," and they thus conclude that "Fe nutrition in plants is likely to be affected by the continued elevation of atmospheric CO 2 , which, in turn, will affect crop production." And as their work strongly suggests, those important effects should be highly beneficial, while even wider biospheric benefits are suggested by the work of Sasaki et al . (1998), who have demonstrated that both the ferric reductase activity and Fe uptake capacity of the marine alga Chlorococcum littorale cultured in Fe-limited media have been significantly enhanced by elevated CO 2 concentrations. References
2 It was determined, according to Sefcik et al ., that "the magnitude of enhancement from exposure to elevated CO 2 was similar for both shade-tolerance groups," with the elevated CO 2 treatment increasing the mean light-saturated net photosynthetic rate by 63% in the shade-tolerant species and by 67% in the shade-intolerant species. More importantly, however, they found that "seedlings grown in deep shade, regardless of shade-tolerance group, showed a greater long-term photosynthetic enhancement to elevated CO 2 than those grown in moderate shade," with the mean long-term enhancement being 47% in moderate shade and a whopping 97% in deep shade. What it means
2 Although elevated CO 2 did not significantly increase total seedling biomass, it did increase it by 14% when averaged across all temperature and fertilization regimes. However, elevated temperature did significantly increase seedling biomass by 55%, when averaged across all CO 2 and fertilization treatments, as did fertilization, by 157%, when averaging across all CO 2 and temperature levels. With respect to root exudation, a similar pattern emerged. Elevated CO 2 did not significantly increase total dissolved organic carbon compounds exuded from seedling roots over a 24-hour period, yet plants grown in elevated CO 2 exuded 20% more such compounds than ambiently-grown plants did, when averaged across all temperature and fertilization treatments. And once again, elevated temperature and fertilization significantly increased root exudation by 71 and 55%, respectively, when averaged across the other main effect variables.
2 Soil microorganisms hold a key position in terrestrial ecosystems, as they mineralize organic matter and make its nitrogen available for use by plants. Hence, it is encouraging to note, in the words of the authors, "that elevated CO 2 will enhance below-ground C- and N-cycling in grasslands," even nutrient- poor grasslands, such as the one they studied. Reference
2 Gutierrez et al .'s findings are perhaps best summed up by the title of their paper: "Acclimation to future atmospheric CO 2 levels increases photochemical efficiency and mitigates photochemistry inhibition by warm temperatures in wheat." They report, for example, that net photosynthesis was increased by 62-72% in both years in the CO 2 -enriched chambers; while at the conclusion of the growing season, total plant biomass production in the CO 2 -enriched chambers was increased by 12-18%. What it means
2 Two years later, Bunce (2005), grew soybean plants from seed to maturity out-of-doors in open-top chambers exposed to normal precipitation while continuously fumigating them with either ambient air (AC) or with air enriched with an extra 350 ppm of CO 2 either 24 hours per day (ECdn) or 14 hours per day centered on solar noon (ECd) for a total of four entire growing seasons . And this sustained effort, in Bunce's words, revealed that "ECdn increased seed yield by an average of 62% over the four years compared with the ambient CO 2 treatment, while ECd increased seed yield by 34%," indicative of the fact that the CO 2 -induced yield enhancement in the 24-hour CO 2 enrichment treatment was almost twice as great as that of the daylight-only CO 2 enrichment treatment.
2 In controlled environmental conditions, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment significantly increased the size and biomass of plantlets, thus reducing the time required to produce propagules for transplanting into commercial potato fields. Although economic costs of CO 2 enrichment were not considered in this study, commercial collaborators involved in the research were "pleased with the CO 2 enrichment results."
2 Elevated CO 2 increased the average steady-state photosynthetic rates of four hardwood understory saplings by 60 and 40% under high and low light conditions, respectively. In going from shaded to lighted conditions, elevated CO 2 had no effect on photosynthetic induction, with ambient and CO 2 -enriched species both reaching 90% of their maximal transient photosynthetic rates at approximately the same time. However, in going from lighted to shaded conditions, elevated CO 2 extended the time during which maximal rates of photosynthesis were maintained. Thus, elevated CO 2 slowed the rate of photosynthetic decline caused by the onset of shading. Consequently, shaded leaves of CO 2 -enriched saplings maintained greater rates of photosynthesis for longer periods of time than did shaded leaves of saplings growing in ambient air, which allowed the CO 2 -enriched leaves to sequester greater amounts of carbon than was expected from photosynthetic measurements made under steady-state conditions.
2 The minimum acceptable value for plants is not that much below the 270 ppm preindustrial value. It is possible that this is not enough, that we are better off with our current level, and would be better off with more still. There is evidence that California orange groves are about 30 percent more productive today than they were 150 years ago because of the increase of atmospheric CO2.
2 Increasing the air temperature by 2C increased ecosystem evapotranspiration ; but the imposition of twice-ambient atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reduced this impact of the temperature increase while simultaneously enhancing ecosystem net primary production. Thus, ecosystem water-use efficiency rose under conditions of simultaneously-elevated air temperature and CO 2 concentration. In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%. Doubling the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, on the other hand, increased soil carbon storage by 5%; and when both air temperature and CO 2 concentration were increased together, the simulated increase in soil carbon content was a full 10%. What it means
2 As for that CO2 "pollution," there is some other good unreported news for farmers, families, and forest creatures. Satellite images reveal a widespread increase of CO2-fertilized greening over 25% to 50% of the "global vegetated area" over the past 35 years.
2 With respect to the first of these findings, Laurance et al . conclude that "the increasing forest dynamics, growth and basal area observed are broadly consistent with the CO 2 fertilization hypothesis," while with respect to the second finding they say that "tree mortality peaked, and tree recruitment and growth declined during atypically wet periods," and that "tree growth was fastest during dry periods, when reduced cloudiness might have increased available solar radiation." Consequently, it would appear that the historical increase in the atmosphere's CO 2 concentration, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has been good for the Amazon's trees, and (very likely) for the rest of the region's plants and animals, even in the face of the local warming of 0.26C per decade that they report for the region since the mid-1970s.

2 As the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere continues to rise, yellow birch seedlings should exhibit increased rates of net photosynthesis, even at higher temperatures, thereby facilitating increased biomass production. With more CO 2 in the air, the beneficial reduction in transpiration and the concomitant rise in water-use efficiency may allow this species to expand its range southward into regions where high summer temperatures and limited rainfall currently discourage its presence. Similarly, yellow birch may also expand northwards, as the additional CO 2 may make seedlings more tolerant to freezing temperatures. Reviewed 1 November 1998
2 A review paper published in Climate Research finds an increase of CO2 fertilization of 300 ppm would enhance productivity of the world's major crops by 34%- 40%. The paper adds to many other peer-reviewed publications finding, contrary to claims of climate alarmists , that increased CO2 will be a boon to agricultural productivity , as well as confer resistance ofrainforeststo climate change.
2 This was from a paper from CSIRO last year, Impact of CO2 fertilization on maximum foliage cover across the globes warm, arid environments , which shows just how much foliage cover has increased across most parts of the world since 1982.
2 Against this backdrop, Ghasemzadeh and Jaafar grew leaf and rhizome extracts from two Malaysian young ginger varieties (Halia Bentong and Halia Bara) under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, studying their antioxidant and in vitro anticancer activities against two human cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). According to the two Malaysian researchers who conducted the analysis, the antioxidant activities of the leaf and rhizome extracts were increased significantly by the elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration; and they found that the greatest enhancement was observed in the leaf extract. In addition, they say their results showed strong inhibitory activity of Malaysian young ginger varieties on human breast cancer cells, indicating that some compounds in Malaysian young ginger varieties possess anticancer activities and may contribute to the therapeutic effect of this medicinal herb.
2 The EPA regulations are said to be necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) which the Greens deem to be a pollutant in our atmosphere. It is not a pollutant, despite a Supreme Court decision that identifies it as such, but rather a gas vital to all life on Earth, used by all vegetation for its growth. CO2 is to vegetation what oxygen is to all animal life. Humans, all seven billion of us, exhale CO2!
2 The five researchers report that both theory and experiments suggest that over the past several decades "plant photosynthesis should have increased in response to increasing CO 2 concentrations, causing increased plant growth and forest biomass." And in this regard they find that "long-term plot data collectively indicate an increase in carbon storage, as well as significant increases in tree growth, mortality, recruitment, and forest dynamism." They also say that satellite measurements "indicate increases in productivity and forest dynamism," and that five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, incorporating plant physiology, competition, and dynamics, all predict increasing gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, and carbon storage when forced using late-twentieth century climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentration data." In addition, they state that "the predicted increases in carbon storage via the differing methods are all of similar magnitude (0.2% to 0.5% per year)." What it means
2 The first reason would be to discuss how the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 a result primarily of the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy is a growing benefit to plant life. This is an appropriate discussion in a dietary context as atmospheric CO2 is a fertilizer that promotes healthier, more productive plants, including crops used directly as food for humans or indirectly as animal feed. It has been estimated that from the atmospheric CO2 enrichment to date, total crop production as increased by 10-15 percent. This is a positive and beneficial outcome and one that most certainly should be included in any discussion of the role of greenhouse gases emissions in diet and nutrition but is inexplicably lacking from such discussion in the DGAC report.
2 The results of this model study of ecosystem response to elevated air temperature and atmospheric CO 2 enrichment in a high-elevation Rocky Mountain watershed are typical of what is found in nearly all ecosystems: improved water quality, enhanced plant water use efficiency, and higher levels of vegetative productivity, all of which consequences lead to greater plant populations and ecosystem biodiversity.
2 In concluding, the five researchers say "it is possible, therefore, to enhance the biomass yield of this green manuring crop by elevating the level of CO 2 in the plant canopy." One low-tech way of doing so is suggested by their statement that "plant residues decomposing on the soil surface following mulching may help elevate the level of CO 2 and thus the plant growth," while we suggest that a longer-term strategy would be for the nations of the earth to not overtly strive to reduce anthropogenic CO 2 emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels; for CO 2 is "the elixir of life."
2 The Sun that nurtures us will eventually incinerate the Earth. According to an article in PNAS, Earth's entire biota are threatened by the eventual loss of atmospheric carbon dioxide. You see CO 2 is plant food and without it there are no plants. Without plants there are no animals, and that includes human beings (assuming we manage to survive until then). The eventual death of the planetary biosphere due to lack of carbon dioxide tells us some things about the current CO 2 induced global warming hysteria. As S. Franck, C. Bounama, and W. von Bloh put it in Causes and timing of future biosphere extinction in Biogeosciences Discussions :
2 In the first place, it explicitly takes no account of any future developments in bio-engineering and genetic modification, which are likely to enable farmers to plant drought-resistant crops designed to thrive at warmer temperatures, should these occur. Second, and equally important, it takes no account whatever of another effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, and one which is more certain and better documented than the warming effect. Namely, the stimulus to plant growth: what the scientists call the "fertilisation effect". Over the past 30 years or so, the earth has become observably greener, and this has even affected most parts of the Sahel. It is generally agreed that a major contributor to this has been the growth in atmospheric CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels.
2 Fact 3. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is beneficial. In increasing quantity it causes mild though diminishing warming (useful at a time of a quiet sun and likely near-future planetary cooling) and acts as a valuable plant fertiliser. Extra carbon dioxide helps to shrink the Sahara Desert, green the planet and feed the world. Ergo, carbon dioxide is neither a pollutant nor dangerous, but an environmental benefit.
2 The scientists begin their article noting that Growth of plants under elevated CO2 frequently leads to increased growth rates, but that was not the focus of their study. Many others have grown tobacco in elevated CO2 and confirmed that tobacco, like virtually every other plant in the world, benefits from higher concentrations of CO2. Matros et al. made a series of measurements on how elevated CO2 impacts nicotine, and they conclude that Cultivation of tobacco plants at elevated CO2 leads to a marked decrease of nicotine, the major nitrogen-rich secondary metabolite in tobacco at lower nitrogen supply and At higher nitrogen supply, nicotine content was not further influenced by CO2. See, if you are trying to quit smoking, elevated CO2 is your friend and it generally acts to lower the nicotine level of the plants!
2 CO2-Related Genotypic Variation in White Spruce (5 Apr 2011) Observations suggest that highly-CO2-responsive genotypes of a wide variety of earths plants -- from food crops to lumber crops -- could well be selected to take advantage of their genetic ability to optimize their growth in response to projected future increases in the airs CO2 content ...

2 Simply said, there is no need whatever to reduce CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide is not "a pollutant" as the EPA claims. It is, along with oxygen for all living creatures, vital to the growth of all vegetation. The more CO2 the better crops yields will occur, healthier forests, and greener lawns. From a purely scientific point of view, it is absurd to reduce emissions.
2 Elevated soil moisture had little influence on wheat yield, regardless of atmospheric CO 2 and O 3 concentrations. Elevated O 3 concentrations, however, negatively influenced wheat yield at both atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Nevertheless, grain yield was always higher for plants grown at the elevated CO 2 concentration. Indeed, elevated CO 2 increased grain yield by 21, 7 and 11%, respectively, for each of the three years of the study, indicating that elevated CO 2 concentrations ameliorated some of the negative impacts of O 3 -induced damage on grain yield.
2 Elevated CO 2 did not significantly impact vegetative growth in three of these weedy species. For Spergula arvensis , however, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment increased maximum leaf length by an average of 15%, regardless of light treatment, and total dry weight by 20 and 68% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Similarly, elevated CO 2 significantly enhanced reproductive success in only one of these species, by increasing the number of seeds in Poa annua by 50 and 26% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Thus, CO 2 -induced increases in vegetative biomass do not necessarily lead to increases in reproductive biomass, and CO 2 -induced increases in reproductive biomass do not need to be preceded by increases in vegetative biomass. In contrast to the limited significant effects of elevated CO 2 on vegetative and reproductive growth, reduced light nearly always caused significant decreases in plant vegetative and reproductive success. Moreover, the negative effects of reduced light on these parameters were typically much stronger than any positive effect resulting from atmospheric CO 2 enrichment. Total plant dry weights, for example, decreased by 32 to 62%, depending upon species, when grown in reduced, rather than in full light, while atmospheric CO 2 enrichment only increased total plant dry weights by 2 to 30%. What it means
2 As the air's CO 2 content continues to rise, poplar trees will likely exhibit increases in growth that will shorten the time from planting to harvest and enhance their importance in the agro-forestry market. Also, with greater productivity and biomass production, significantly more carbon will be sequestered within the woody components of poplar trees and the soils in which they grow, helping to slow the rate of rise of the air's CO 2 content. Thus, the use of Populus species in managed tree plantations would appear to be a promising and prudent cultural practice for future foresters.
2 First off, plant height, leaf number, leaf area, fresh weight, and dry weight all increased in the elevated CO 2 treatments with respect to values obtained under ambient conditions, regardless of the length of CO 2 exposure (see Table 1 below). Leaf stomatal conductance also benefited at the higher CO 2 level, being reduced by nearly 50% by the end of the 10-week experiment.
2 Where are the defences of bristlecones as valid proxies in tree ring terms? While we??ve pointed out a number of possible mechanisms for fertilization in the 20th century, the most prominent theory is CO2 fertilization The usual mechanism by which CO2 fertilization is hypothesized to lead to increased ring widths is through increased water use efficiency. Water use efficiency changes are studied in a series of remarkable articles by Xiahung Feng of Dartmouth, of which Tang, Feng and Funkhouser is notable. "Plant water use efficiency" was defined by Farquhar et al 1989 (cited by Tang et al) as the ratio of net carbon fixed to the total water cost. The connection between CO2 fertilization and increased water use efficiency (W) is summarized by Tang et al. as follows:
2 Among other things, Pardos et al . report that seedling relative growth rate rose 2.2-fold when going from the lowest to the highest combined light-water treatment in the elevated CO 2 environment, but only 1.6-fold when doing so in the ambient CO 2 environment. In addition, they say that "cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO 2 under low-watered and high-illuminated conditions." What it means
2 Ameye et al . conclude that "if soil moisture is adequate, trees will experience negative effects in photosynthetic performance only with the occurrence of extreme heat waves." And in light of the fact that "elevated CO 2 diminished these negative effects," they opine that "the future climate may not be as detrimental to plant communities as previously assumed."
2 When I hear concerns about soil erosion, I always think about my grandma. She was an amazing woman. She grew up in Huron in the heart of the Great Depression, which just happened to coincide with the Dust Bowl. Growing up, my sister and I listened to her stories of dealing with the dust storms, stuffing rags in the window sills and the cracks around the doors in an attempt to keep the dust out of the house. Despite her best efforts, a fine film of dust would still cover the interior of the house.The dust from the Dust Bowl claimed crops, cattle, and the lives of two children in Huron. To this day, when contractors cut into houses that survived the Dust Bowl, they find sand in between the interior and exterior walls. The Dust Bowl eroded more than the soil; it eroded a way of life.Erosion is a problem that persists to this day, and it's responsible for dust storms, mudslides and sinkholes. Fortunately, plants in forests, grasslands, and everywhere else set roots in the soil and help the soil stay put, and plants around the globe are getting a boost from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Although many people, spurred by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, think "going green" means using less carbon dioxide, plants prefer just the opposite.We all know plants need carbon dioxide to breathe, but many don't know plants turn that carbon dioxide into carbon in the form of the roots, stems, trunks, branches, leaves, and fruit with which we are more familiar. And according to a new study by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the greener the planet gets.The report, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts, published by The Heartland Institute (where I am a research fellow), cites thousands of peer-reviewed studies rising atmospheric CO2 levels are helping almost all plants grow bigger, become more efficient in using water, and better withstand the stress of high air temperature.In a way, this CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere is to plants like an oxygen mask is to a winded football player helping to prepare him for the next play.More CO2 in the atmosphere also means plants start to grow in places they couldn't before, reducing the amount of erosion and, consequently, dust in the air in places around the globe, while increasing the potential for agriculture and wildlife habitat as the range of certain plant species expands.Increased levels of CO2 also have been found to increase the fine-root density in some plants by up to 184 percent, and a 55 percent increase in above ground biomass despite water and nutrition limitations meaning plants become better at anchoring the soil in place and allowing water to permeate the surface, which is especially important during droughts.This would have been great news for my grandma and everyone else who survived the Dust Bowl. Improved farming techniques have played an important part in reducing the amount of erosion around the world, and these efforts certainly will be helped by having more CO2 in the atmosphere. Instead of being a detriment to plant growth, more CO2 acts as a fertilizer, making plants grow bigger, faster, more resilient, and more abundant, greening the world we live in.
2 At a fundamental level, carbon dioxide is the basis of nearly all life on Earth, as it is the primary raw material or food that is utilized by plants to produce the organic matter out of which they construct their tissues.
2 The answer is as simple as not interfering with the historical and still-ongoing increase in the atmosphere's CO 2 concentration, since this latter phenomenon dramatically increases the water use efficiencies of essentially all agricultural crops -- see Water Use Efficiency (Agricultural Species) in our Subject Index -- thereby enabling farmers to produce ever-increasing quantities of the vast array of grains, fruits and vegetables, as well as animal feed crops, upon which the inhabitants of all nations of the earth ultimately depend for their sustenance, all of which can be accomplished without the need to extract ever greater quantities of ever-more-difficult-to-obtain water from earth's soils.
2 Typically, a doubling of the airs CO2 content above present-day concentrations raises the productivity of most herbaceous plants by about one-third; this positive response occurs in plants that utilize all three of the major biochemical pathways of photosynthesis.
2 Regardless of atmospheric oxygen concentration, shoots of both mint and thyme exposed to elevated CO 2 produced substantially more biomass than shoots grown at 350 ppm CO 2 . At an ambient O 2 concentration of 21%, for example, CO 2 -enriched shoots of mint and thyme attained fresh weights that were 3.1- and 5.8-fold greater, respectively, than those reached by shoots exposed to ambient O 2 and CO 2 concentrations. What it means
2 LaDeau and Clark determined that "carbon dioxide enrichment affected mean cone production both through early maturation and increased fecundity," so that "trees in the elevated CO 2 plots produced twice as many cones between 1998 and 2004 as trees in the ambient plots." They also report finding that trees grown in elevated CO 2 "made the transition to reproductive maturation at smaller diameters," and that they "not only reached reproductive maturation at smaller diameters, but also at younger ages." By 2004, for example, they say that "roughly 50% of ambient trees and 75% of fumigated trees produced cones." In addition, they observed that "22% of the trees in high CO 2 produced between 40 and 100 cones during the study, compared with only 9% of ambient trees." What it means
2 The four researchers report that their data indicated that for both maize and grain sorghum, there was a "maintenance of relatively high canopy photosynthetic rates in the face of decreased transpiration rates resulted in enhanced water use efficiency when these plants were grown at elevated CO 2 of 720 ppm, but not at 360 ppm." And as a result, they demonstrated that "both plants maintained growth better at double-ambient CO 2 than their counterparts at ambient CO 2 in the presence of drought," such that reductions in total above-ground biomass due to drought were 42% for maize and 36% for sorghum at ambient CO 2 , but only 18% for maize and 14% for sorghum at double-ambient CO 2 .
3 But such infinitesimal estimates of averted global warming would only apply, of course, if Kyoto's signatories actually complied with its provisions. They are finding it virtually impossible to even do that.
3 36: Wind and solar are unreliable. 37: They can only replace a small fraction of our energy need. 38: Todays economy runs on inexpensive energy. 39: To grow the economy we will need to use fossil fuels to generate extra wealth. 40: We will need to burn more fossil fuels to find replacements for fossil fuels.
3 The economics also work against a major transformation in the technology of producing power, either mobile or stationary. Coal is cheap. Natural gas is becoming even cheaper, but its carbon emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are still half those of coal and three-quarters those of gasoline per unit of energy produced. Although a switch to natural gas for many power uses would help, and accounts for recent drops in U.S. emissions, it cannot change the carbon arithmetic enough to prevent the world from exceeding "safe" levels.
3 Coal remains the lowest-cost fuel for electric generation and remains the mainstay of base load power in the U.S. and many countries. Access to affordable energy is essential in the U.S. at a time when 48 million Americans live in poverty and a record 115 million qualify for energy assistance. China and India will not forego low-cost coal for base load power in favor of high-cost, non-dispatchable electric generation from renewable energy sources.
3 Sprawling wind and solar installations and transmission lines across millions of acres of wildlife and scenic areas will kill millions of eagles, hawks, and other birds and bats.
3 What's often ignored is that the creation of green jobs through subsidies and regulation inherently leads to the destruction of job opportunities in other industries. That's because any resource forcibly taken out of one sector and politically allocated in favor of renewable energy cannot be invested elsewhere. In our country, green energies are subsidized through a premium that every electricity consumer pays on his electricity bill (about 4.3% of the average bill). That helps to make Italy's electricity costs among the most expensive in Europe. In particular, big industrial consumers pay the most for electricity in Europe (at least 25% above the EU average in 2008, according to Italy's energy regulator).
3 In 2012 Germans paid 20 billion for green energy that otherwise could have been produced for about 3 billion. The extra cost is because of green subsidies that will have almost no effect on Global Warming even a 100 years from now. If all that money was spent on energy research instead, Germany would actually help solve Global Warming.
3 Biomass is a fancy name for plant material and vegetable trash which, if maintained in/on the soil, will provide the fertility for the next crop. Burning it reduces the humus that maintains fertile soil. The ultimate biomass stupidity is to harvest American forests, pelletise them, dry them and ship them across the Atlantic (all using hydrocarbon fuels) to burn in a UK power station. Burning biomass produces the same emission gases as coal.
3 ???By not enforcing , the administration provides little incentive for companies to build wind farms where there are fewer birds. And while companies already operating turbines are supposed to avoid killing birds, in reality there??s little they can do once the windmills are spinning.??
3 Approve the Keystone XL pipeline and streamline energy infrastructure projects. The next Administration's easiest decision may be to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Keystone XL is environmentally responsible, will not contribute significantly to climate change, will boost the economy, will increase the supply of oil to America's Gulf Coast refineries, and will provide much needed energy infrastructure. Further, the recent growth in domestic oil and gas productionsometimes in nontraditional areas, such as North Dakotahas resulted in transportation delays. Streamlining the environmental review and permitting processes for new pipelines and grid investments is a welcome step for managing new supplies. However, taxpayers should not subsidize those investments, and Congress should eliminate any federally imposed cost-socialization requirements through which regulatory agencies support expensive, uneconomic projects by spreading the costs to citizens who derive little, if any, benefit from those projects. Additionally, Congress should be mindful of protecting private property rights and respect the state authority to control local and regional needs.
3 Senator Harry Reid says he may still try to pass even a minimalist renewable energy bill in the Senate, and then use it to ram through an economy-disrupting climate bill during a lame duck session, if even by a single vote. That would make the United States the only country to enact draconian climate and energy rules in the midst of a recession sending millions of jobs overseas, where energy prices and regulatory regimes are more hospitable and governments believe people have a right to better lives.
3 Besides, should there be any real surprise that the plant isnt likely to be any budget bargain? After all, wasnt that the whole idea all alongrun up the cost of fossil energy so high that it would even begin to make subsidies for stratospherically costly and unreliable wind and solar boondoggles appear competitive? Isnt that what cap-and-trade was all about?
3 We at CFACT hope President Obama and the Congress will make the full journey towards energy realism and concede that we can't run our country on subsidies and technologies that feel good, but don't meaningfully produce the energy needed to fuel our economy. So far the climate and energy proposals being floated in Congress have been all pain, no gain. Cap and trade, offsets, and subsidies will enrich a few carbon profiteers, but do nothing to secure our energy future, nor meaningfully affect our climate.
3 Lyons told me: "The biggest issue facing utilities is the closure of 300 coal-fueled power plants. This represents tens of thousands of jobs in the coal mining industry and billions of dollars of revenues for local, state and federal government." There are no plans to effectively replace the comparatively cheap electricity. Progressive thought leaders Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhous state: "Energy poverty causes more harm to the poor than global warming" and cheap energy "makes the poor vastly less vulnerable to climate impacts."
3 The American people deserve better. The nations existing coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants could continue to deliver reliable and affordable electricity for decades to come, if not for the EPAs costly and disruptive climate agenda.
3 Section III challenges the economic basis of AB 1493 and ARB's regulatory proposal. AB 1493 fails a reasonable cost-effectiveness test in two ways. First, even if the theory of catastrophic global warming were true, the emissions reductions achieved by AB 1493 would make no detectable difference in global temperature trends over the next 50 years. As environmental policy, AB 1493 is all cost for no benefit. Second, AB 1493 will raise the sticker price of new cars more than it will lower operating expenses for most consumers.
3 Given the manifest reluctance of the worlds big emitters to accept any legally binding carbon targets and in face of our deepening economic crisis, Europe should undertake a comprehensive review of its economically damaging carbon targets and in the absence of an international agreement should consider the suspension of all unilateral climate policies that threaten Europes economic recovery. Benny Peiser, National Post, 25 November 2011
3 At least the Government admits for the first time that the wind doesn?t always blow; so it proposes a Capacity Mechanism to subsidise the building of dozens of gas-fired power stations, to be kept running all the time, emitting CO2, just to provide instant back-up for when the wind drops. More than once on these recent cold, windless days, the contribution of wind to our electricity needs has been as low as 0.1 per cent ? so the back-up to all those turbines will cost billions more, doing much to negate any CO2 savings from the turbines when they work.
3 To summarize, industrialized countries indeed have a historical responsibility for industrialization. But industrialization has been a net boon to humanity not only for industrialized countries but developing countries as well. The real problem may well not be climate change but ill-considered climate change policies that would use crops for energy production thereby increasing hunger, poverty, and the threat to biodiversity.
3 Most plants will not grow without energy from the sun. Solar arrays steal energy directly from the biosphere. Some incoming solar energy is reflected to space by the panels, some is converted to waste heat on the panels, and some is converted to electricity much of which ends up as waste heat. Solar radiation that could have given energy to growing plants is largely returned to the atmosphere as waste heat and much is then lost to space.
3 Kerry and Graham support a border tax to protect American jobs from products produced in countries that don??t commit to reducing their emissions. That is an admission that energy prices are going to go up and so are the prices of goods and services that are produced with or use energy. Consumers will be poorer as a result and hence will be able to afford fewer goods and services. Bye-bye manufacturing jobs. They also claim that their as-yet-to-be-written bill will reduce our imports of foreign oil. That??s plausible, but not exactly correct. As our economy declines, we will need less oil. But it will reduce U. S. and Canadian production first because the production costs are much higher here than in Saudi Arabia.
3 To wit, that a) gasoline prices are beyond his control, but b) to the extent oil and gas production is rising in America, his energy policies deserve all the credit, and c) higher prices are one more reason to raise taxes on oil and gas drillers while handing even more subsidies to his friends in green energy. Where to begin?
3 First, energy efficiency through legislation is a Trojan Horse for the green goal of energy rationing.
3 But the real stakes are much higher. They are the businesses, jobs, families, living standards and liberties that will be increasingly threatened if President Obama, EPA, Big Green and the United Nations remain free to impose their climate and energy agenda. Responsible governors, state legislators and members of Congress must get involved, block these actions, and roll back the destructive policies.
3 Their goal is to end the hydrocarbon and nuclear era in America, and force us to convert to "renewable" energy. Beginning January 2, they plan to ignore clear voter mandates and consumer needs and use regulations and executive edicts to slash carbon dioxide emissions, impose "clean energy standards," halt onshore and offshore drilling, and hobble the vehicles, electrical generating plants and factories that are the backbone of our nation's economy, jobs and living standards.
3 As IPCC leaders have explained, the climate change agenda is no longer about the environment. It is now about intentionally transforming the global economy and negotiating the redistribution of the worlds wealth and natural resources, in the name of social justice and equal distribution of misery.
3 Regulation of markets and government subsidies to promote corn to ethanol conversion have distorted the existing economic allocation by diverting food to energy use. This raised equilibrium prices, increased energy supply by a small fraction (US corn ethanol accounted for less than 1% of US energy consumption in 2009 and reduced grain for food by a much larger one (US corn used for ethanol production is 4.3% of the total world grain production, even after allowing for the feed byproduct.
3 Taxes on energy use or on carbon emissions could raise California's electricity bill from $2.6 billion to $10.4 billion, an increase of 12.5 to 50 percent. A tax on motor fuels of $.50 per gallon would add at least $7.7 billion to California's annual driving costs, a 40 percent increase; and a $1.00 tax would add $15.4 billion, an 80 percent increase. A BTU tax on natural gas, oil and coal of $.60 would add 6.1 percent to California's energy costs and a $1.00 BTU tax would increase annual costs by 10.6 percent.
3 NADA Chairman Bill Underriner doesnt agree with EPAs argument for higher fuel efficiency standards: This increase shuts almost 7 million people out of the new car market entirely and prevents many millions more from being able to afford new vehicles that meet their needs.
3 The world stands on the verge of committing itself to limits on the emission of carbon dioxide that would drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels. If this fateful decision is made, the economies of developed nations will be strangled. Human prosperity will be reduced. Our ability to solve pressing problems, both human and environmental, will be severely limited. We have been told that these shackles must be imposed to forestall a hypothetical global warming projected to occur some time in the distant future. But to date the only unambiguous evidence for planetary warming is a modest rise in temperature (less than one degree Celsius) that falls well within the range of natural variation.
3 and since the cost of AB 32 (direct & indirect) is at least $116 Billion, the cost to "avoid global warming" per 1 C would be $116,000,000,000/.000087429 = $1,326,790,881,744,043 ($1.3 Quadrillion per degree). Note: Global GDP (61.1 trillion) is less than 5% of this amount. Looks like the cost/(assumed benefits) ratio is rather high, even if you are a true believer.
3 If, asalmost certainly would happen, the mandates compeldifferent actions and investments than industry would otherwise undertake to meetthe cap,then the same emission reductions would be achieved athigher cost.Thetargeted mandates and incentivescan only substitute more costly GHG cuts for those that could have been made at lower cost.
3 Further, most other programs to create jobs create the jobs much more cheaply, without the knock-on effect of higher energy costs requiring schemes to mitigate the impact on seniors and the poor. Tahtis to say, paying workers to dig ditches and fill them up again is less economically harmful ??? that is, more wise ??? than green jobs schemes.
3 - Low-cost, coal-fired electric power is vital to the jobs, incomes, and health of millions of Americans. Complete elimination of coal-fired power by Kyoto-style regulation could reduce household income by as much as $225 billion in 2010, and induce 14,000 to 25,000 premature adult deaths, especially among minorities and the poor.
3 What it conspicuously fails to do, however, is to make any assessment of the unequivocally adverse economic impact of the decarbonisation policy it continues to advocate, which (if implemented) would be far worse than any adverse impact from global warming.
3 United Kingdom manufacturers say "green energy" policies and increased penalties for using fossil fuels are raising their costs to intolerable levels, especially for energy-intensive industries. Manufacturing is "reaching a tipping point," they say, "where companies that are internationally mobile will say "enough is enough,'" and simply move to Asia. Millions of jobs are on the line.
3 Recent studies on Spain , Germany , and Denmark suggest that, in fact, RES subsidies destroy, not create, jobs a remarkable result, since these three countries are widely regarded as the most successful models in Europe. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office found similar results.
3 Climate experts tell us that a 1930s style global economic depression is needed to stabilize the climate.
3 One in five people in the UK still live in poverty, often without enough money to heat their homes or to eat healthily. The new report shows that the poorest people in the UK will be most affected by the effects of climate change. They tend to live in poorer housing, have poorer health, less access to home insurance, and less money to adapt to price rises. Their situation could be worsened by measures to combat climate change such as higher taxation on fossil fuels.
3 The CO2 emissions per capita are nearly proportional to the GDP per capita - but no one cares about this particular number, anyway. Costa Rica has something like 2 tons of CO2 per capita and year while the Netherlands has 23 tons or so. If you reduce your emissions to 1/10, your wealth will drop to 1/5 or so, which is about 0.7th power of 1/10.
3 States' CO2 "Nuisance' Suit Threatens Already-Staggering Economy
3 Furthermore, to demand a "global" solution is tantamount to asking poor countries to commit economic suicide. Such rhetoric reinforces the perception, tirelessly promoted by greenhouse lobbyists, that Kyoto foes are motivated solely by greed. Worse, those who attack Kyoto as a trade bonanza for developing countries can only encourage such nations to make whatever symbolic or token "commitments" it takes to keep Kyoto alive.
3 Europe must invest ???2.9tn to meet 2020 emissions goal ( other sources ) the EU commitments to reduce the carbonization of the economy before the year 2020 will cost a staggering ???2.9 trillion which is $3.9 trillion.
3 "The Tailoring Rule is an illegal solution to an administrative nightmare of EPA's own making," said Lewis. "Having failed to get Congress to enact cap-and-trade, the Obama Administration is using the Clean Air Act to achieve the same results: higher energy prices, lower economic growth, and jobs shipped overseas," said Myron Ebell, Director of CEI's Center for Energy and Environment.
3 Obama adviser Martin Feldstein notes that "the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the resulting increases in consumer prices" from capping the amount of carbon dioxide energy users can emit "would raise the cost of living of a typical household by $1,600 a year," a figure that "would rise significantly" from year to year.
3 The Supreme Court ruling was an important victory for those of us concerned about the burdensome costs of EPAs regulatory agenda, but it came too latethe damage from MATS is already done. However, there is still time to save Americans from the harmful impacts of EPAs so-called Clean Power Plan. State policymakers like you must protect American families by rejecting policies that make electricity more expensive and less reliable. Without your help, unlawful regulationseven if struck down in courtwill shackle American families with higher costs for decades to come.
3 A State Global Warming Policy Could Destroy the Economy
3 Taylor argues that the early numbers from a joint federal-provincial group analyzing the potential economic impact of Kyoto show the costs to be unacceptable. He told the National Post (March 28, 2002), "My understanding is that the numbers that will come out of that process will be higher than Ottawa has expected and so looking outside that process now at other studies to see what they can find."
3 These hundreds of billions are being paid by ordinary families and small and medium-sized businesses in what is undoubtedly one of the biggest wealth transfers from poor to rich in modern European history. Rising energy bills are dampening consumers? spending, a poisonous development for a Continent struggling with a severe economic and financial crisis.
3 No such green hijacking is going to take place in Canada, at least not without an official fight. On the eve of hearings, which begin Tuesday in Kitimat, B.C., into the $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline to carry the same oil sands production from Alberta to the West Coast and on to China the Harper government clearly aims to do what Barack Obama cannot or will not do in America, namely stand up to the growth-killing professional green movement. (Financial Post)
3 President Obama took it all back and now offers the possibility of a little bit of offshore exploration and calls it a compromise. His purpose is clearly to draw moderate support in the Congress for global warming legislation that will raise energy prices for consumers and industry. The Republican staff of the House Natural Resources Committee have provided a useful analysis that includes some very revealing maps. My comments are here .
3 YouTube - Obama Poised to Cede US Sovereignty, Claims British Lord On October 14, Lord Christopher Monckton, a noted climate change expert, gave a presentation at Bethel College in St. Paul, MN in which he issued a dire warning regarding the United Nations Climate Change Treaty which is scheduled to be signed in Copenhagen in December 2009.
3 By the end of 2013, and despite having spent $2.5 billion, Michigan??s nine oldest coal plants will continue to operate while having their emissions trimmed by no more than 5 percent. But had we chosen to build gas plants instead of wind plants, that same $2.5 billion could build 2,500 MW of gas generating capacity instead of only 225 MW. This is enough to permanently close half of the nine ???dirty coal?? plants in question.
3 The study states that if cars in Europe reach the required10% biofuel target set by the EU for its cars by 2020, massive damage will threaten the environment and poor citizens globally.
3 The EPA is the governments ultimate enemy of energy, though the Department of the Interior and other elements of the government participate in limiting access to our vast energy reserves and energy use nationwide. By government edict, the incandescent light bulb has been banned. How insane is that?
3 Clean Power Plan: In June 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to control greenhouse gases from existing power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan. The unprecedented rule would regulate the entire electric industry, rather than on a source-by-source basis as had been EPA's practice for 40 years. As such, the proposed Clean Power Plan would grossly expand EPA's authority into the states' traditional authorities. For 80 years, States have overseen retail electricity markets shielded from federal intrusion. The Clean Power Plan would radically alter this arrangement, which dates from the New Deal, such that state authority would now fall under the thumb of EPA approval. In addition to posing grave federalism concerns, the rule would be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the power sector, costing between $41 billion and $73 billion per year.
3 This group naturally includes the United Nations and all of its subsidiaries, the EU, and left wing politicians and media everywhere. At a news conference in Brussels recently, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.??s Framework Convention on Climate Change, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity, but to change the economic development model ie destroy what is left of free enterprise and private property. See:
3 And here is Christopher Moncktons powerful explanation of what it will really mean, which can be summed up in three points: global government, global wealth redistribution and global enforcement, all without any democratic process whatsoever:
3 The one thing you dont hear President Obama mention is how much his proposed emissions reductions will reduce global warming, wrote Curry. The social costs of carbon estimates made by the White House require assumptions out to the year 2300 for drastic carbon dioxide reductions to be cost effective.
3 The fundamental problem with Obama's approach to carbon-dioxide emissions is the idea that the U.S. can solve the problem. No matter what the U.S. does, emissions will continue to soar, because so many people in the developing world want to come out of the dark and into the bright lights of modernity. Proof of that can be seen in yet one more number that's easily found in the BP data: Over the past decade, global carbon-dioxide emissions would have risen by 2.6 billion tons even if U.S. emissions had gone to zero.
3 Someday, China's leaders may, for their own reasons, alter their stance on climate. If so, and if Beijing can verify that it will adopt a price on carbon emissions, Washington should be ready to match it. For the foreseeable future, though, Beijing's verifiable preferred price on carbon is zero. Until that number changes, the main U.S. line of defense against the risks of climate change is not a carbon tax. It remains a free and productive economy.
3 The global temperature savings of the Kerry-Lieberman bill is astoundingly small0.043C (0.077F) by 2050 and 0.111C (0.200F) by 2100. In other words, by centurys end, reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 83% will only result in global temperatures being one-fifth of one degree Fahrenheit less than they would otherwise be. That is a scientifically meaningless reduction.
3 "A strategic initiative that is aimed at substituting alternative fuels for fossil fuels in the production of one kind of energy is doomed to failure unless it somehow eliminates the value of using the same fossil fuels to produce other kinds of energy. If Mr. Gore really wants to spur the United States and other countries to use alternative fuels to produce electricity or any kind of energy, he should just sponsor legislation to prohibit the use of fossil fuels. Otherwise, he is just blowing smoke."
3 That isnt all; a Department of Labor program to create green jobs has largely misfired. It has created only 2 percent of the projected jobs and the cost per job created is more than $120,000 .
3 How many workers does it take to change an incandescent light bulb in California? Two. One to install its energy-efficient replacement, and another to ensure the job complies with government regulations. BeholdTom Steyers green jobs stimulus, which a new report from the Associated Press shows has been a colossal failure even by its proponents standards.
3 The White House ordered the review after criticism of a $528 million loan to Solyndra Inc., a solar company that went bankrupt.
3 The new rules are part of President Obama's effort to combat global warming, but are only anticipated to reduce global temperatures by .018 degrees by the year 2100.
3 Kyoto was supposed to reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide below 1990 levels during the period 2008-2012. But since it was signed, the atmospheric concentration of this putative pollutant continued to rise, pretty much at the same rate it did before Kyoto. (Even if the world had lived up to the letter of the Kyoto law, it would have exerted an influence on global temperature that would have been too small to measure.)
3 Full implementation of all nations' commitments under the Paris agreement, at a cost of $1 to $2 trillion annually from 2030 onward, would, as Bj rn Lomborg calculates even while assuming the IPCC's exaggerated estimates of CO2's warming effect, reduce GAT in 2100 by just 0.17 C, an amount too little to have significant impact.
3 In other words, by regulating companies that provide more than 80% of our primary energy out of business and raising subsidies sky-high for windmills and sunbeams that provide 4%, we will be able to reduce global temperatures by an estimated 0.03 Celsius before the next century.
3 But let's not stop there. Let's use our imagination and assume that China reduces its emissions by 20 percent by 2030. That gets us two tenths of a degree. Throw in a 30 percent reduction by Europe and Japan and the rest of the industrialized world, also by 2030. That's another two tenths of a degree, for a grand total of 0.425 degrees, under a "climate sensitivity" (loosely, the effectiveness of greenhouse gas reductions) assumption 50 percent greater than that adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latest assessment report. Is an effect that small worth 1 percent of global GDP, or roughly $600 billion to $750 billion per year, inflicted disproportionately upon the world's poor?
3 Should you respond that any journey begins with a tiny step, consider the following. The Obama climate policy calls for a 17 percent reduction below 2005 levels in U.S. GHG emissions by 2020. If we apply the EPA's own climate model, that would reduce temperatures by the year 2100 by fifteen one-thousandths of a degree. In addition, the U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change calls for an additional 10 percent reduction by the U.S. by 2025. (The Chinese commitment it's unenforceable is for a "peak" in their emissions by 2030. Total emissions at that peak and the emissions path after the peak are not addressed.) The additional 10 percent U.S. reduction yields another one one-hundredth of a degree. The standard deviation of the temperature record is about 0.1 degrees, so that these effects would be too small even to be measured, let alone to affect sea levels and cyclones and all the rest.
3 Denmark was responsible in 2010 for about 0.15% of the worlds human emissions of CO2. Global temperatures by 2100 should rise by less than 3C. If their emissions dont change, the Danes are therefore likely to be responsible for up to about 3 0.0015 = 0.0045C of that global temperature rise, which nobody will detect in the environment. For that undetectable reward, they will endure much.
3 "For both developing and industrialized countries, net GDP per capitaalbeit an imperfect surrogate for human well-beingshould be (1) double the current US level by 2100 under the warmest scenario , and (2) lowest under the poorest IPCC scenario but highest under the warmest scenario through 2200. The warmest world, being wealthier, should also have greater capacity to address any problem, including warming. Therefore, other problems and, specifically, lowered economic development are greater threats to humanity than global warming."
3 Focused adaptation designed to reduce vulnerability more broadly to todays urgent health problems would deliver greater reductions in deaths at a lower cost than climate mitigation policies, Dr Goklany added.
3 JC comments: Over the last 5 years or so, I have been framing my research and applications related to extreme weather events around the concept of resilience. I viewed resilience as a concept that was orthogonal to sustainability, and realized that infrastructure designed for sustainability may make it more vulnerable to natural hazards. Zollis essay makes the argument that sustainability and resilience are tied to two different world views, and I find his argument convincing. Resilience thinking is associated with systems thinking, uncertainty, and wicked problems. Resilience is arguably a concept that has broader political palatability than does sustainability. Resilience thinking seems to be a particularly good match for dealing with extreme weather events, which is arguably associated with the greatest impacts from climate variability and change.
3 Finally, in case we do conclude that we want to roll back atmospheric carbon levels, we should look into things like carbon sequestration, or geo-engineering, that might let us influence the climate without plunging ourselves back into an economic stone age.
3 To build on these promising beginnings during the course of the negotiations will in my view require several further recognitions and realizations. First, the major developing nations need to recognize that playing the game they have been playing may seem clever now, but won't work over the long haul. China and India have enthusiastically supported a second round of mandatory emissions cuts for the developed nations, but not for them. They hope that in a second round the developed economies will have to pay billions and billions of dollars to them to install modern emissions-saving technologies and also that energy-intensive industrial production will continue to move from carbon-constrained economies to theirs. China, India, and other developing and poor countries understand that going on an energy starvation diet when you are already energy poor offers far more pain than gain. The potential harms caused by global warming are minor annoyances when compared to the immense benefits of affordable energy. Instead of playing a cute double-faced game, China and India should articulate the reasons why the demands from the energy-rich nations for them to accept mandatory emissions reductions before the technology is available to make those reductions affordably are simply another form of eco-imperialism.
3 From this article: The report also suggests that allowing carbon-constrained U.S. firms to trade credits with firms in China or India, where emission reduction measures are relatively inexpensive, would yield an estimated U.S. carbon price as low as $15 per tonne rather than $40 per tonne, thereby saving the American economy about $145 billion per year in increased energy costs. So while the Earth appears to be cooling , we should pay real money to China for highly-questionable "emission reductions" that would, at best, "cool" the world by an additional amount too small to measure? And while we make those payments, China would continue to build two new coal plants per week ?!
3 But there's the rub. To get results will require widespread cooperation among countries. Even if developed countries froze their emissions, worldwide emissions would still grow around 150 percent by 2050 because of the increase from developing countries. Moreover, if China or India does not eventually agree to binding targets, some greenhouse-gas producers will simply set up shop there because it is cheaper.
3 The problem is that the basic approach is unworkable. International negotiations have centered on placing the economic burden of addressing climate change on a few dozen developed countries while asking nothing from more than 150 developing countries. But the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly the developing world. Any approach to effectively address increasing emissions of greenhouse gases must capture emissions from developed and developing countries.
3 China and India, among other developing countries, argue that they should be allowed to increase carbon emissions. They're still developing and require higher rates of economic growth. Moreover, they aren't responsible for previous emissions, and on a per capita basis U.S. emissions are much higher.
3 The idea of just flicking the switch from coal and other fossil fuels to renewable energy is a fantasy. It cannot be done.
3 The challenge for Spain was to transform that free resource into an industry that made economic sense and attracted investors. The first problem lawmakers encountered was price. Solar power, like wind and other renewable-energy sources, cant yet compete on price against electricity generated from natural gas or coal.
3 Renewable energy is both more expensive than and as damaging to the environment as energy produced from natural gas or coal, says Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute. Writing in the Washington Times (Aug. 4), he points out that the usual argument that traditional energy fuels are unfairly subsidized has been judged groundless by the General Accounting Office. The GAO said fossil fuel subsidies are "too small to have a significant effect on the overall level of energy prices and consumption in the United States."
3 I may comment further on these reports in a future post. In the meantime, Iwill simply observe that if Babcock is correct, and U.S. biofuel policies have only a small influence on food prices because ???a large expansion in US ethanol production would have occurred even if the subsidies and mandates had not been in place,?? then U.S. taxpayers get little or no energy-security bang for billions of biofuel bucks.
3 Costly renewable energy policies are already set to raise California power costs by $5 billion or 33 percent due to expensive and unreliable wind and solar energy. However, that may be only half of the additional cost, since the"California Public Utilities Commission has called on utilities and private companies to install about $5 billion worth of batteries and other forms of energy storage to help the state power grid cope with the erratic power supplied by wind and solar energy."
3 This says a lot for the lack of economic viability of palm oil biofuel if it doesnt look favorable with high subsidies. Maybe there is an upside to this. Havent we been hearing about deforestation from palm oil or other biofuel production being an environmental and climate problem?
3 The report uses an economic model of New Zealand which is totally unsuited to analysing the effect of 20% energy generation from wind. Any model that does not take into account the intermittent and seasonal nature of wind and its effect on power prices and the fact that, in a dry year, hydro cannot back up wind, is worthless. The model makes no allowance for the fact that over peak demand periods, only about 10% of the wind generation can be relied on. It also does not consider the need for extra transmission lines and the poor efficiency of the gas fired power stations that must be built to back up wind. For example, one study in the United States showed that, in Texas, a large amount of wind energy results in a tiny reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
3 Climate sceptics have been asking about discrepancies in the economics of solar panels for years. We still have questions about their carbon footprint, but they become moot as solar panels are killed off by economics.
3 This refers to the cardinal problem of solar and wind energy, the intermittency of power generation that depends on the weather. The year has 8,760 hours; wind turbines, however, only produce for 1,530 hours at full power, photovoltaic systems even just for 980 hours. To make matters worse, no one knows in advance when green electricity is fed into the grid, and when its not available.
3 The highly touted, government-subsidized, unreliable, intermittent and expensive alternative power schemes currently in vogue are nothing but a phenomenal waste of money. As evident from the described wind farm in Germany, the required technology is not in place at this time, perhaps may never be.
3 Wind energy proponents cling to the idea that we must reduce fossil fuel use and believe, therefore, that the extra cost is worth it. However, because of the intermittency issues with wind and the reliability demand from the consumer, it requires fully dispatchable back-up power generation. Natural gas is the best form of backup because it can be easily adjusted to produce more or less electricityhowever, the constant adjustment required to supplement wind or solar energy results in less efficient use and more CO2 emissions.
3 But what has all this doom and gloom got to do with the governments drive for renewable energy, you might ask? Well, the entire problem with renewables almost all renewables is that they are dangerously intermittent power sources.
3 Toronto Star; Coping with surplus wind power will cost Ontario electricity ratepayers up to $200 million a year if market rules don't change, says the power system operator. Moreover, it says, if it can't control the flow of wind and solar power onto the Ontario grid, then "reliable and economic operation of the power system is, at best, highly compromised and likely not feasible." When there's more power than the system can handle, the IESO sells it to neighbouring provinces and states -- sometimes at a loss, and sometimes actually paying them to take it. No worries, there's plenty of wood in the Greenbelt . h/t AK
3 The above chart shows German power supply by the various sources available and demand over the last 30 days. The lions share of Germanys installed renewable energy (wind and sun) went just about completely AWOL three times during the period. Chart source: Agora .
3 Conclusion: The concept of generating and delivering green energy with offshore windmills and cross-country transmission lines for its delivery not only faces a lot of protest, but it would be super-expensive, unreliable, and would require the abandonment of market principles, which happen to heavily favor France right now.
3 The total electrical energy consumption by Germany during the first 25 days was approximately 33 terawatt-hrs. That translates to anaverage of 55 gigawatts of power every hour. If the wind turbines had operated at 100% capacity for the entire time, they still would have only supplied 60% of Germanys needed power. However, wind turbines rarely run near 100% rated capacity. Very often they produce only a small fraction of their rated capacity because the wind is highly variable and often does not blow very hard. On April 18 wind turbines in Germany produced their peak for the month: 17 gigawatts, but only for about 2 hours, before rapidly dropping off again to 8 GW at around midnight. On that day, all wind turbines together briefly reached 53% of their rated capacity. And that was their best day.
3 The findings will deliver a body blow to governmental claims that their current target of generating 27 percent of energy from renewable sources mostly wind and solar by 2030 is credible.
3 But how reliable is the technology? The turbines are intended to run for 20 years but in some cases they have had to be pulled in after only eight years. It remains to be seen whether this is a particular feature of the North Sea conditions or a more general aspect and if the latter, it must seriously jeopardise the future of offshore wind energy. (Forbes)
3 The project of transforming biomass into fuels by using catalytic pyrolysis, or cracking, an invention by a company in the Netherlands, BIOeCON , turned out to be a renewable money pit for KiOR which produced very little energy.
3 Since 2000, Germany has used the EEG to promote the expansion of renewable forms of energy. To ensure that the construction of expensive solar and wind farms is worthwhile for private individuals and investors, they receive a guarantee that the electricity they produce will be purchased at a fixed price for a period of several years.
3 All this argues for a closer look at the cost/benefit relationship of investing in renewable energy projects, to prevent a massive waste of financial and natural resources on unreliable and thus uncompetitive forms of energy. Since every cloud has a silver lining, the ongoing economic crisis might give extra impetus toward that end.
3 Often wrong but never in doubt, the geniuses of the green community. Repeat after mefor miles driven ethanol produces more carbon dioxide because it is less energy dense. Moreover ethanol burns hotter and is hydrophilic so it is hard on engine parts. Ethanol adds increase the cost of fuel, it has a big land, carbon and water use footprint, and it only survives because of the politics of the ethanol mandate and a little thing called the Iowa caucuses along with our friends at Archer Daniels Midlands and the farmers who are getting rich on high priced corn while mexicans cant afford tortillas.
3 Widely hailed as "green" sources of renewable energy, hydroelectric dams have been built worldwide at an unprecedented scale. But University of East Anglia research reveals that these major infrastructure projects are far from environmentally friendly. A PLOS ONE study reveals the drastic effects of the major Amazonian Balbina Dam on tropical rainforest biodiversity. It reveals a loss of mammals, birds and tortoises from the vast majority of islands formed by the creation of the Balbina Lake
3 Environmental groups must first understand the functional failure of industrial wind and focus on that issue alone. For once it is clear that the sacrifice demanded is not worth the benefit derived, the turbines will come tumbling down. Only then will be environment begin to heal.
3 John Bennett of the Ontario, Canada Sierra Club, has accused Wind Concerns Ontario (WCO) as being supported by the Progressive Conservatives (PCs). Im a liberal, and I support and volunteered for WCO after my town was ruined by wind turbines, the Sierra Clubs and the PMs agenda and enforcements.
3 As Dan Kish, Senior Vice President of the Institute for Energy Research in Washington, D.C., observed in an interview I posted last March , the Obama administrations apparent intent is tomake heavily subsidized, unreliable and costly renewable energy programs they are pushing more cost-competitive. This is the Tonya Harding approach to energy break your opponents kneecap if you cant win fair and square.
3 Energy storage concepts such as accumulators, power-to-gas, compressed air storage are plagued by low efficiencies and sky-high costs. He reminds readers that using electriccar batteries as a storage media is also a pie-in-the-sky-vision. Gehlert tells IKZ:
3 Carbon sequestration frustration :: iNSnet Captured CO2 must be compressed to about 100 times atmospheric pressure (which takes energy), transported to a suitable underground reservoir (which takes energy) and pumped into the ground (which takes energy). A coal-fired power plant that sequesters its CO2 must burn about 30 percent more coal than conventional plants to cover these energy needs. And that extra coal must first be mined (which has environmental effects) and transported to the plant (which takes fuel) the list goes on and on. Even with this extra burden, a CO2-burying plant emits between 71 and 78 percent less CO2 than a normal coal-fired plant for each unit of usable electricity produced, Koornneef and his colleagues report. But when the researchers factored in all the cradle to grave pollution of a CO2-burying plant, emissions of acid rain-causing gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides were up to 40 percent greater than the total cradle-to-grave emissions of a modern plant that doesnt capture its CO2.
3 The capture and subsequent geologic sequestration of CO 2 has been central to plans for managing CO 2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. The magnitude of the task is overwhelming in both physical needs and cost, and it entails several components including capture, gathering and injection. The rate of injection per well and the cumulative volume of injection in a particular geologic formation are critical elements of the process.
3 In Tuesday's speech, Obama did point to one success: "Since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America." The United States is the only industrialized country to actually lower carbon emissions. We've done it, not through extreme policiesbut through private enterprise embracing our abundant natural gas. Encouraging extraction in the U.S. and approving Liquefied Natural Gas export terminals would reduce global carbon emissions and help our economy.
3 According to the WSJ editorial, from 2008-2012 the U.S. became the worlds natural-gas leader, with production increasing by nearly fourfold since 2008. The U.S. added 600,000 miles of gas pipeline, a 30% increase, utilities substituted gas for coal on a massive scale, and the economy grew. Methane emissions nonetheless fell.
3 Such is the hunger for energy that 80% of all new North American oil and gas drilling now utilizes this technique, which, in its current form, is barely a decade old. Fracking requires enormous amounts of water, which has midwifed the birth of a highly lucrative water services industry.
3 Pope Francis' concern for the environment is admirable. But to keep the poverty-reducing engine of economic growth running, it is necessary to continue to use fossil fuels. Our air is getting cleaner, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future as new capital replaces old. Abandoning fossil fuels would hurt the most vulnerable in societies throughout the world.
3 General Electric and Chesapeake Energy have formed an alliance to promote the use of natural gas as a fuel for cars and trucks, in a bid to capitalise on the US shale gas boom.
3 If I told you that you should hate coal, oil and natural gas, you might think I was crazy and you would be right. Everything we do involves these three energy reserves and the U.S. has so much of them that we could be energy independent of the rest of the world while, at the same time, exporting them.
3 Hydraulic fracturing has helped companies tap potentially decades of gas supply and huge amounts of oil from previously inaccessible shale formations dotted across the United States in recent years.
3 Pressure groups and governing elites used to argue that we are running out of oil and natural gas. That ploy no longer works. While fossil fuels may eventually prove finite, fracking has given us vast new supplies of petroleum and huge coal, oil and gas deposits have been placed off limits by government decree. We have at least a century to develop alternative energy sources that actually work that create real jobs, actual revenues, lower energy prices and true prosperity without the mandates, subsidies, deception, fraud and corruption that are the hallmark of green energy schemes.
3 Another analogy can be drawn with the U.S. exploration and production sector, which did very well to develop lots of natural-gas reserves. But the resulting oversupply has damaged the economics of the business. Value is accruing instead to those who transport and use the fuel. Increasingly, the likes of Exxon Mobil are muscling in. These bigger companies are willing and able to absorb the near-term pain of low prices in anticipation of a coming age of gas.
3 The technically recoverable natural gas resources in the United States total 40 percent of the worlds natural gas reserves. At 2,744 trillion cubic feet, it can fuel natural gas demand in the United States for 175 years at current usage rates, or selectively, it can satisfy the nations residential demand for 857 years or the nations electricity demand for 575 years.
3 Despite the Obama administrations efforts, coal will likely continue to play an integral role in providing the general public with inexpensive and reliable baseload electricity that powers our economy and affords Americans a high standard of living, Eick said.
3 But we have to keep our eye on the ball long-term, Jacoby says. Hes concerned about how cheap gas will affect much cleaner sources of energy. Wind and solar power are more expensive than natural gas, and though those prices have been coming down, theyre chasing a moving target that has fallen fast: natural gas.
3 The real red herring is the bogus climate crisis, which diverts public attention from Keystone XL??s manifest benefits: an estimated 42,100 new jobs and $2.3 billion inadditional GDP during the 2-year construction period, enhanced integration and efficiency of North American energy markets,stronger (rather than strained) U.S.-Canadian relations, and ??? compared to alternate delivery modes ??? fewer oil spills and feweraccidents .
3 Even if American companies choose not to drill at current oil prices, they can move quickly if prices rebound, said Joseph Stanislaw of JAStanislaw Group LLC, an energy advisory firm. U.S. drillers ability to pump lots of crude from shale caught the world by surprise, he said. And part of that surprise is that it is not as expensive as most people thought and is more durable than most people thought.
3 Fracking regulations. State and local regulation and cooperation with industry, constant refinements and improvements in rules and practices, and accommodation to public concerns about water, drilling and fracking fluids, road congestion, community impacts and other issues have been ongoing for decades. That is part of the reason that 2.5 million instances of fracking worldwide (over 1 million in the USA) since 1949 have not caused any serious harm. Thats a safety record any industry would envy.
3 Every day, humans continue to choose fossil fuel energy because it is one of the best forms of energy, and I work at a refinery, helping people to use that energy.
3 Yes, oil, gas, and coal producers should be worriedand the individuals and industries that count on America's abundant, available and affordable energy should be afraid, very afraid.
3 These competitive advantages have resulted in an overwhelming preference for electricity over the ten-year period, as installed natural gas capacity is projected to increase 38 percent over the ten-year period, while coal is projected to increase by only 6 percent, NERCs assessment said. Its predictions of demand for new generation have been overly generous in the past but now appear to be more realistic (Table 1). The EIA predictions of electricity demand growth do not include peak demand growth as a separate category, but rather predict energy consumption will grow 8.2% through 2018. Together, the NERC and EIA data clearly show that the need for additional, dispatchable load during on-peak hours will be a primary focus for electricity system planners. Expect more gas-fired reciprocating engine and combined-cycle plants designed for intermediate peaking service to be announced in the coming year.
3 Citing climate concerns, he has refused to permit construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, and blocked or delayed Alaskan, western state and offshore oil and gas leasing and drilling. He's proud that US oil production has climbed 58% and natural gas output has risen 21% since 2008. But he doesn't mention that this is due to hydraulic fracturing on state and private lands; production has actually fallen in areas controlled by the federal government, and radical environmentalists oppose fracking all over the USA.
3 Mini-nuclear and geothermal are stand-alone power sources, in contrast, and produce no CO2.
3 A nuclear facility would be an even lower pollution option, but would cost more than coal. In my view, Small Modular Reactors are clearly the future and they have significantly less environmental concerns than does a large nuclear facility. Here is an interesting study on SMR economics.
4 As the concentration of greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere increases, they effectively trap more and more heat in this lower layer, causing it to warm and causing the layers above to cool. But this sentence is not a verified fingerprint. It's just a parroted proclamation from the global warming religion - a hypothesis that has been falsified about 10 times in the text above. It has been demonstrated that the effect above, whether it looks attractive or not, is not sufficient - and maybe not even necessary - to explain most of the climate change in the real world.
4 Official climate science is based on the corrupted work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). One proof of corruption is the constant moving of the goalposts. Theyre not moved to accommodate new evidence but to defend the hypothesis. A major example occurred in 2000 when CO2 continued to rise but temperatures declined, contradicting the claim that a CO2 increase caused a temperature increase. Global warming became Climate Change.
4 Most climate models have falsely predicted global warming: Despite growing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, temperatures are not rising. Snow in the winter is however a side-effect of global warming, climate scientists say.
4 Read here . The UK's highly publicized Stern report on global warming impacts has been analyzed extensively and now finds itself on the ash heap of likely fraudulent, totally misleading economic/science research.
4 In his enviro-propaganda flick, An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore claims nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred in the last decade. That's been a common refrain for environmentalists, too, and one of the centrepieces of global warming hysteria: It's been really hot lately -- abnormally hot -- so we all need to be afraid, very afraid. The trouble is, it's no longer true.Last week, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies -- whose temperature records are a key component of the global-warming claim (and whose director, James Hansen, is a sort of godfather of global-warming alarmism) -- quietly corrected an error in its data set that had made recent temperatures seem warmer than they really were.A little less than a decade ago, the U.S. government changed the way it recorded temperatures. No one thought to correlate the new temperatures with the old ones, though -- no one until Canadian researcher Steve McIntyre, that is.
4 In the dogmatically blind worlds of liberalism and environmentalism, the truth is irrelevant. Lomborg was never a climate skeptic as they originally hysterically claimed. Now he continues with his views, but they are conveniently and falsely misrepresented as rejecting climate skepticism. Two lies make a truth in the dogmatically dark world of liberalism and environmentalism. The only truth is Lomborg, the liberals, and the environmentalists still know nothing about climate science.
4 Year after year, alarmists have changed their protective shells for more absurd answers regarding where the Earth has mysteriously stashed all the energy that greenhouse gases supposedly trapped. For years, alarmists said ocean waters were storing the missing energy. But when the ARGO project demonstrated that the heat was not in the ocean, at least down two kilometers (1.2 miles) beneath the surface, one prominent alarmist responded, "We are puzzled at the results." We are not puzzled.
4 There was, however, an inconsistency in the argument of the scientists. Scientists consistently drew on short-term temperature increases in order to give climate change meaning:
4 This is just unbelievable; ???the UWA experiment??. Think about what this refers to: University of Western Australia. This is where Cook launched his career defaming climate skeptics by helping Stephan Lewandowsky in designing/running a gussied up poll that was never actually posted on climate skeptic websites , that purports to give answers by climate skeptics, to be used in a paper where it is claimed that climate skeptics are believers that ???the moon landing was faked ???. What sort of ???experiment?? was John Cook running by stealing the identity of Dr. Lubos Motl, and writing comments under his name?
4 At this point I am reminded that James Hansen raised the alarm about global warming in 1988 when he had less than a decade of noisy global warming data on which to base his concern. The amount of warming heobserved between 1980 and 1988 was far smaller than known natural variations and far larger than the IPCC would go on to say was due to AGW during that period. So whatever the eventual outcome of the AGW debate, logically Hansen had no scientific case.
4 The ability of climate models to simulate large-scale temperature changes during the twentieth century when they include both anthropogenic and natural forcings and their inability to account for warming over the last 50 yr when they exclude increasing greenhouse gas concentrations has been used as evidence for an anthropogenic influence on global warming. new simulations support previous work by showing that there was a significant anthropogenic influence on near-surface temperature change over the last century. NO.
4 Of course there is nothing wrong, or at least not much that is wrong, with the ideals behind any of the above agendas except perhaps the last couple on the list. But the battles over them should be fought in the open and on their own merits rather than on the basis of a global warming crusade whose legitimacy is founded on still-doubtful science and on massive slabs of politically correct propaganda.
4 Starting today, world leaders are beginning a two-week meeting in Copenhagen in a bid to change the entire direction of the global economy. They will do so, not on the basis of empirical scientific facts about global warming, but on alarmist computer-modelled predictions based on a swath of raw temperature data. Oh yes, and the scientific integrity of those doing the feeding and interpreting the results.
4 Climate modelers like Kevin Trenberth would never be able to run another computer model telling us how hot our future apocalypse might be, since his NCAR computer is run by Wyoming coal . Likewise, NOAA??s Gaea supercomputer will be DOA since it can??t run on recycled vegetable oil.
4 Michael Mann of Penn State University who fabricated and contrived the headline graph in the UN's 2001 climate assessment report which falsely attempted to state that the middle ages were not warmer than the present day when the scientific, historical and archaeological consensus was and is that the middle ages was substantially warmer throughout the world and that today's temperatures are not exceptional.
4 How should he global warming scare be combatted? The scientific theories promoted by the global warming advocates are soft targets. Their science is lousy. But critical scientific arguments are highly technical and only of use in getting authoritative scientists to join the skeptical side. To influence the vast majority of citizens, including non-specialist scientists, emotional arguments are necessary. My suggestion would be to paint a picture of a future when global warming promoters get what they want and everyone else loses money, mobility, jobs, etc. Combine this with authoritative scientists saying that global warming dogma is scientifically flawed and you have a winning formula.
4 Most importantly, a human influence on climate is constantly asserted, even in the absence of evidence. Any doubts of that influence are expunged or buried deeply where they are hard to spot.
4 Galloping Camel writes: The IPCC issued its fourth assessment report (AR4) in 2007, updated for the Copenhagen conference in 2009. This report raised a fire storm of criticism which elicited only a feeble response. As a result the IPCC?s credibility has been seriously damaged. Will the new ?AR5? report correct the faults of its predecessors?
4 In response to questions, Mann claimed that the scientific consensus represented by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agreed completely with him. On the other hand, his critics had been discredited and were not taken seriously by the same consensus. Inasmuch as Mann must be somewhat familiar with the literature in his own field, it is hard to conclude otherwise than that Mann was lashing out in an attempt to preserve what may be left of his own reputation. Although Mann's disgraceful performance contained nothing of scientific merit, it provided much entertainment and indicated a possible alternative career in Don Rickles-style heckling.
4 "Carbon math," wrote Mr. Lazear, "makes clear that without major effort and a good bit of luck, we are unlikely to control the growth of emissions enough to meet the standards that many climate scientists suggest are necessary." Those scientists are usually on college or university faculties where securing federal and other grants to study a warming that is not occurring leads to urging limits on carbon dioxide. Others are just huge liars who, like Al Gore, have been making predictions of warming that have not and are not coming true.
4 Prominent climate alarmists had to respond . Some, like Michael Hockey-Stick Mann, remain stalwart. Others, like James Hansen, first admitted the global temperature standstill was real , then, in what may have been a faux pas, said the lack of increased warming was due to an increase in global coal consumption.
4 Seeing is believing, but things are not always what they seem. Skeptical Science , a Web sitedevoted to debunkingglobal warming skepticism,asserts that Spencer??s claim about recent warming being only 50% of what the model consensusprojects is ??? flat-out ridiculously wrong ?? (original emphasis). Observed warming has been ???spot on consistent with climate model projections,?? Skeptical Science contends. The evidence, supposedly, is in the graph below (click on it to activate the presentation).
4 15) How Significant is the Climategate Release of E-Mails? While Climategate does not, by itself, invalidate the IPCC?s case that global warming has happened, or that humans are the primary cause of that warming, it DOES illustrate something I emphasized in my first book, ?Climate Confusion?: climate researchers are human, and prone to bias.
4 IPCC Gate Du Jour: UN climate change panel based claims on student dissertation and magazine article
4 What follows is a sordid tale of a graph that overthrew decades of work, conveniently fitted the climate models, and was lauded triumphantly in glossy publication after publication. But then it was crushed when an unpaid analyst stripped it bare. It had been published in the highest most prestigious journal, Nature , but no one had checked it before or after it was spread far and wide. Not Nature , not the IPCC, not any other climate researcher.
4 Section I challenges the scientific basis of AB 1493 and ARB's regulatory proposal. The balance of evidence lies against the belief in an impending climate catastrophe. Global warming alarmism is based on hyperbole and fear, not science.
4 Baliunas: The science altogether is unsettled, but we know for sure that the models that make the predictions into the future are exaggerating the warmth. . . . The fact that we stop emitting carbon dioxide will do nothing to change the course of the climate. . . .
4 Lord Monckton's speech was anticipated by all and he didn't disappoint. His tongue-in-cheek British humor was entertaining, but then Monckton turned serious. It was because of Lord Monckton that the "Hockey Stick" report by the IPPC was thoroughly discredited. As Monckton described it, bogus facts were used to construct the computer model in an attempt to show that the rate of global warming is accelerating and that it's because of man.
4 I??m assuming that CA readers are aware that, once the Yamal series got on the street in 2000, it got used like crack cocaine by paleoclimatologists, and of its critical role in many spaghetti graph reconstructions, including, most recently, a critical role in the Kaufman reconstruction.
4 The IPCCs pundits like to claim that the published evidence for humanity causing warming greatly outweighs any published evidence against it. This appeal to majority opinion on their part is pretty selective, though. They had no trouble discarding hundreds of research papers supporting evidence for the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age when they so uncritically embraced the infamous Hockey Stick reconstructions of past temperature change.
4 However, several assessments have shown that the techniques and methods used to derive and verify the IPCC's climate predictions are fundamentally flawed. They indicate that the IPCC's central claims that the present warming trend is unusual, caused by human activities and will result in serious harm are not supported by scientific forecasts. Rather, these claims are opinions that are no more likely to be right than wrong.
4 Read here . All of a sudden, global warming alarmists are blaming the cold and snowy weather on human CO2-caused global warming. For those who don't appreciate the irony of the previous sentence, it has become a world-wide joke that all, and every , worldly condition is a direct result of human CO2 global warming.
4 I've encountered some folks who appear offended by the title of my new book Climate of Corruption: Politics and Power Behind the Global Warming Hoax. Why do you call it a "hoax"? they ask. Why not refer to the matter as a debate? The reason is quite simple: A debate describes a discussion in which participants competitively argue opposing points of view that are assumed to be based upon honest positions.
4 This is the second episode in the Cobar ACORN-SAT series examining BoM adjustments to the CDO temperature data here I start to look at adjustments to minimum temperatures. The 1st episode looked at maximum temperatures. A list of ACORN adjustments to Cobar data is here and you can see the first min adjustment listed is 1st Jan 1972 meaning the adjustment factor applies to all data earlier than that. You will see it is labelled as Statistical meaning there is no evidence for it in station diaries or admin records but it derives from computer driven comparisons sifting data differences from multiple stations as far away as Parkes and Hillston see map. In this case of the 4th adjustment the following stations data was used.
4 By 1989, Ann Henderson-Sellers was talking in terms of 100 years, and hinted that it might even be as much as 500 years. In effect, the lack of sufficient global warming this century has not caused the modelers to question their theoretical assumptions, or their models, but merely to seek excuses.
4 NCDC and NASA diligently attempt to ignore this phenomenon, and adjust about 0.1 degrees F for UHI.
4 Climate change skepticism seeps into science classrooms (L.A. Times) In the text above, an activist named Ms Neela Banerjee is crying that the "deniers" have succeeded in many states of the U.S. in their efforts to regulate the expansion of the global warming propaganda at schools. At some places, teachers are required to discuss the existence and/or arguments of climate skeptics.
4 Even when climate alarmists cheat by cherry-picking the data they use to show climate models are consistent with observed temperatures, their efforts fail.
4 Robert Pielke Jr (c/f wattsupwiththat) gives a more scientific (and thorough) debunking of the basis of the report, concluding This report is an embarrassment to the GHF and to those who have put their names on it as representing a scientifically robust analysis. It is not even close. Link broken (02/13) , but referred to by Delingpole in the Telegraph and Climate Depot
4 Solomon also checked on a science historian named Naomi Oreskes "who had arrived at an absurd findingthat no studies in a major scientific database questioned the UN view of climate change."
4 So when he says I merely insist that a scientific debate should take place in the scientific literature he is telling a massive lie. His own blog is testament to that. Along with every magazine article, interview and opinion piece.
4 So it would appear the temperatures that NOAA now declare for 1934 are no more than a theoretical reconstruction. But without the transparency to show how this has been done, how can we have any confidence that it has been done properly. There is a potential discrepancy of 0.6F in Virginia; if this is extended across the whole country, it would destroy the claim that this July was the hottest month on record as July 1936 was only 0.13F cooler on NOAAs record. Indeed this would only the 5th warmest July in the CONUS.
4 By oversimplifying the climate story, it appears that the IPCC's projections are just straightforward physics: The 2 C to 6 C projected rise in global average temperature is the direct, linear result of increasing CO2. But in reality, the IPCC claims that CO2, acting alone, will result in only a 1.2 C rise in temperature. The rest depends on whether the climate amplifies (positive feedback) or diminishes (negative feedback) CO2 forcing.
4 nan
4 In addition to tweaking recent temperature readings to be higher, NOAA's revisions to earlier original data have consistently made past temperatures cooler.
4 The real wild card is in the behaviour of clouds, which have a number of strong effects (both on albedo and LW trapping) and could in theory cause a large further amplification or suppression of AGW-induced warming. High thin clouds trap a lot of LW (especially at night when their albedo has no effect) and low clouds increase albedo. We really dont know from first principles which effect is likely to dominate, we do know from first principles that these effects could be large, given our current state of knowledge. GCMs dont do clouds very well but they do mostly (all?) suggest some further amplification from these effects. Thats really all that can be done from first principles.
4 Skeptics assert that the influence of carbon dioxide on the earths temperatures and on climate is greatly overstated and the position of the advocates is unsupported by physical evidence.
4 Hes right that the consensus is real (among government funded climate scientists). But thats not evidence about the climate, its evidence about scientific processes, monopoly science, and university culture not the climate. The problem for Manne is that this assumes that 1/ science-the-human-practice is uncorruptible, and 2/ scientists are unaffected by human ambitions, money, fame, bias or ...uh... simple error. Can humans be human? We skeptics think so.
4 How do theyattributethe heatwave to global warming, if they dont even understand what caused it?
4 Lets take a look at how well the CMIP3 climate models simulated the lack of warming for the Indian & Pacific Oceans Plus sea surface temperature data over the last 19+ years. See Figure 4. The multi-model ensemble mean of the CMIP3-archived climate models simulate continued warming of that dataset during that period. The simulated sea surface temperatures marched happily on their way skyward. Why? Because theyre FORCED by greenhouse gases, while the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans are not. As noted on the graph, If The SST Anomalies Of The Indian & Pacific Oceans Plus Dataset Were Warmed By Greenhouse Gases They Would Have Warmed 0.31 Deg C.But they havent warmed.
4 Reality may be a bit simpler, or much more complicated. But the reason this is all so important is that if there is no good explanation for the lack of warming, then an increasingly viable alternative is that we have overestimated the gross sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide in our computer models.
4 The IPCC says in its latest report: "The differences in radiative forcing estimates between the present day and the start of the industrial era for solar irradiance changes and volcanoes are both very small compared to the differences in radiative forcing estimated to have resulted from human activities. As a result, in today's atmosphere, the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes. "(Ch.2, p.137) This position will be more closely considered. The change in the total solar radiation since 1750 is estimated by the IPCC to 0.12 (-0.06 / +0.18) W/m2 (Ch.2, Table 2.12). This value is of the order of the relative change per decade of satellite measurements. ACRIM has measured as for the cycles 21-23% or 0.5W/m2 0037. The absolute error is about the satellite but with 3W/m2. How could you determine, however, without satellites in the past such small changes is not explained. To a completely different result, however come Solanki and Fligge (CRL 26 (1999) 2465). Their reconstruction shows the next graphic: Both the absolute and the relative values are more than one order of magnitude larger than the values specified by the IPCC.
4 An example of how to scare people by cherry picking - the use of selected data - is shown in The Department of Infrastructures State of Australian Cities Report , which claimed that the ocean near Perth was rising at three times the global average. They did not use all the data available (from 1897), but from 1993, which happens to be the lowest level in local tide gauges since 1941. This is shown on Fig. 1, but it is clearer on Fig. 2 for Hillarys. If it had used 1999 instead of 1993, it would show that sea level was falling. By cherry picking suitable dates you can get any rate and outcome - you want.
4 UK "Scientific" Projections of Global Warming Impact Found To Be Entirely Without Merit & Misleading
4 It's not clear that we need any structure for limiting "greenhouse gases," so shaky is the science and so tenuous the relation between "global warming" and internationally enforceable emissions limits targeted against fossil fuels.
4 The hypothesis of damaging, man-made warming is a long way from being proven and, given the recent trend in the peer-reviewed literature, is well on the way to being disproven. Recent cooling of the planet further suggests that man-made warming is at best too weak to be detected in the noise of natural internal variability.
4 Many of us came to the conclusion that the case for the currently promoted anthropogenic global warming hypothesis is very weak. We also know that it is always wrong to pick a simple, attractive, perhaps appealing scientific hypothesis, especially when it is not sufficiently tested and non-contentiously pushed forward, and to base ambitious, radical and far-reaching policies on it ? without paying attention to all the arguments and to all the direct and indirect as well as opportunity costs associated with it. The feeling that this is exactly what we have been experiencing motivated me to write a book with the title Blue Planet in Green Shackles, which was published in May 2007 and in which I attempted to put the global warming debate into a broader perspective. A year after its publication, I was extremely pleased to get a book An Appeal to Reason, A Cool Look at Global Warming, in many respects similar to mine, written by Nigel Lawson.
4 The next graph overlays Hansens 1988 forecasts (blue) on his 1981 forecasts. Sometime between 1981 and 1998, he completely lost the plot.
4 Where does this leave us? In paleoclimate terms, using the adjustment for dissolution as calculated above, the temperature differences in the Pacific Warm Pool are less than one would expect. My guess is that the dissolution adjustment in glacial times will be less than in warm times ??? there??s substantial evidence at modern sites that dissolution is not as serious a problem at cooler sites. However, as long as one is speculating on the proportion of dissolution in the foraminifera, there are layers of uncertainties that are not even hinted at in Hansen et al 2006. We don??t know what the pre-dissolution values of Mg/Ca for the Holocene Optimum were and so comparing modern instrumental values to core top values is little more than speculation. Having said that, Mg/Ca levels in the Holocene Optimum were relatively warm within the Pleistocene ??? reinforcing the observation that the Holocene is a relatively mild period within the Pleistocene. Prior to the last few years, this was usually believed to be a ???good thing?? in human terms.
4 So, as of 2013, weve had in place a new technology for about a decade that promises to give us the data we need to begin to understand this largest component of the global water cycle. Now consider that there are known ocean processes that portray themselves in the sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and that we have reasonably complete sea surface temperature records stretching back to the late 1800s. These ocean processes portray themselves as modes of natural variability with patterns in time (cycles) that last for 50 to 80 years. Can we hope now, with only 10 years of data, to understand how those multidecadal processes portray themselves below the surfaces of the oceans? The realistic answer is no.
4 A new pound of black asphalt was added to a U.S. weather station, making it darker and warmer? Has Anthony measured the climate sensitivity to be 50 degrees Celsius per doubling? Or does he have a proof that CO2 is cooling the planet?
4 We are told that it is only long term trends that matter, but it must be remembered that satellite monitoring of sea ice only began in 1979. Such a short period certainly is not long enough to establish long term trends, particularly when the big ocean oscillations work on 60 year cycles.
4 The authors also find major problems in the "reanalysis" data of downwelling summertime shortwave radiation and downwelling summertime longwave radiation in comparison to the actual satellite observations, finding,
4 1988 ??? Dr Fred Wood published in the Elsevier journal his critique of Jones et al 1986 ??? online with the tetchy Wigley & Jones team reply. Reading Wood and the team reply is a great way to build your understanding of the poor science prevailing around the birth of GW.
4 Just what have he and Catriona Hurd done? They have looked at published OA papers from 1993 to 2014 465 of them, which must have been an incredibly time consuming task mostly laboratory manipulation experiments (manipulating atmospheric CO 2 concentrations associated with ocean water tanks, usually with oceanic organisms, and pH manipulation of the same). They evaluated each one for inappropriate experimental design and/or analysis of results. The main issue and the major problem with the papers, though not the only one, dealt with the replication, or lack of, of experimental units.
4 If the UKMO states theres debate about to the impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on the AMO, and if the AMO is the most dominant mode of multidecadal variations in surface temperatures, then how can UKMO claim its well understood and thatthe 1940s-1970s pause in global warming islinked to a substantial increase in the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere?
4 We deniers, of course, do not have to explain weather events. All we need do is continue to point out that there is no scientific evidence that manmade emissions of carbon dioxide are causing harm.
4 We now show why the hundreds of rocket and atmospheric scientists, physicists, and aeronautical engineers who created the gold standard and final 1976 version of the US Standard Atmosphere Database (created during the ice age scare of the 1970's and just one decade prior to the global warming scare of the 1980's) in effect were "deniers" of any significant "radiative forcing," "heat trapping," or "radiative imbalance" from any greenhouse gases in their physical chemical calculations of the temperature profile of Earth's entire atmosphere from the surface all the way to the edge of space at ~100 kilometers altitude.
4 Paper 1 provides a good observational summary of observations of a range of climate variables over the past 2-5 decades. In looking at these plots, I was struck by the disagreement among the different measurements/estimates of the same variable, notably humidity/water vapor and cloudiness.
4 But today we are supposed to believe climate variability is due to humans and computer models can now forecast climate changes with amazing accuracy. These models and the alarmist scientists behind them say greenhouse gases will increasingly trigger more severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species and ecosystems, a recent UN report insists.
4 As has been acknowledged by numerous scientists, the engine intake data are clearly contaminated by heat conduction from the structure, and as such, never intended for scientific use. On the other hand, environmental monitoring is the specific purpose of the buoys. Adjusting good data upward to match bad data seems questionable, and the fact that the buoy network becomes increasingly dense in the last two decades means that this adjustment must put a warming trend in the data.
4 Over time, thermometers are added, and they slowly migrate south and to both the new, and old, worlds . Eventually, about 1900 A.D., there are sufficient thermometers on the globe to get a partial idea what is happening . But climate is subject to cyclical changes. Some, like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have about a 40 to 60 year full cycle length. Others, like solar cycles that run 178 years, and Bond Events a 1500 year cycle , are a bit longer. A 100 year record is inadequate to allow for these events.
4 Direct determination of changes in oceanic heat content over the last 20 years are not in conflict with estimates of the radiative forcing, but the uncertainties remain too large to rationalize e.g., the apparent pause in warming. Wunsch and Heimbach
4 "Professor Turney and his fellow evacuees must accept the embarrassing failure of their mission shows how uncertain the science of climate change really is. They cannot reasonably do otherwise." The Australian
4 No computer model has ever been validated. An early draft of Climate Change 95 had a Chapter titled Climate Models Validation as a response to my comment that no model has ever been validated. They changed the title to Climate Model Evaluation and changed the word validation in the text to evaluation no less than describing what might need to be done in order to validate a model.
4 Q 2: Why was the consensus wrong? Why do the models exaggerate? The climate-sensitivity equation says warming is the product of a forcing and a sensitivity parameter. Three problems: the modellers definition of forcing is illogical; their assumptions about the sensitivity parameter are not falsifiable; and their claims that their long-term predictions of doom are reliable are not only empirically disproven but theoretically insupportable.
4 This is a seasonal adjustment to compensate for meltwater on top of the ice, which would ordinarily be viewed as ???open water??. Right about now, the Arctic sea ice gets melt pools forming on the surface. If these are not compensated for, sea ice extent will read artificially low.
4 The reality is that, except in the most general terms, we are unable to satisfactorily explain past variations of climate. Over the recent 2 million years why did the primary mode of climate oscillation change from a 40,000 year (axial tilt) periodicity to one close to 100,000 years (linked to eccentricity)? And how do we explain the recent glacial cycles, given that annual solar insolation intercepted by the Earths disc changes little between near circular and more eccentric orbits? Even the relative regularity in value to which temperatures asymptote during each interglacial, as estimated from Antarctic ice cores, can hardly be attributed to chance yet does not have an explanation!
4 IRag= Certain gases will absorb different wavelengths of radiation (a characteristic of the light ) depending on the construction of the gas. Some gases do not absorb IR , there construction will not allow them to absorb the IR, they may absorb other forms of radiation but as was said above they still radiate IR. Many other materials including water will absorb IR. These should not be included in the term IRags. The words greenhouse gas effect has never been proven by creditable scientific experiments and therefore will only be used when absolutely necessary.
4 There isvery significant (and difficult)challenge of accurately representing the role of snow albedo effects on climate, as well as the role of human activity in altering this albedo over time and space.
4 So the next time anyone says the peer-review process ensures that only decent research gets published, you know how to respond.
4 ???In the 1960s and 1970s, a growing scientific consensus held that the Earth was entering a period of global cooling akin to the Little Ice Age,?? says Solomon.
4 There are large uncertainties in underlying assumptions about population growth, economic development, life style choices, technological change, and energy alternatives. . . . Scenarios for future greenhouse gas amounts, especially for CO2 and CH4, are a major source of uncertainty for projections of future climate. . . . The period of record is now long enough to make it useful to compare recent trends with the scenarios. . . . The increase of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the past decade, averaging 0.6 percent per year, has fallen below the IPCC scenarios. The growth of atmospheric CH4 has fallen well below the IPCC scenarios. (emphasis added)
4 Since the complex models have failed in this respect, and since there are insufficient deep-ocean observations to provide reliable quantitative evidence of the putative heat accumulation below 2000 m, still less to determine the mechanism of the imagined heat transfer, still less again to apportion duly the respective contributions of anthropogenic, solar and subsea volcanic influences on the benthic heat accumulation, it is surely unreasonable for our simple model to be expected to do what the complex models have self-evidently failed to do and what cannot be done by any model, simple or complex, unless and until measurements of far higher resolution than is now to hand become available at all points of the oceanic column. For instance, the 3500 automated Argo bathythermograph buoys have a resolution equivalent to taking a single temperature and salinity profile in Lake Superior less than once a year: and before Argo came onstream in the middle of the last decade the resolution of oceanic temperature measurements was considerably poorer even than that, especially in the abyssal strata.
4 While examining tide gauge records from Atlantic City's Steel Pier , Mr. Galvin discovered a remarkable effect apparently caused by spectators who came to watch horse-diving between 1929 and 1978. From old photographs, it was estimated that there must have been about 4,000 spectators who would come to watch. Given that this crowd probably weighed about 150 tons, the pier was subject to significant loading and unloading cycles. The initial 1912-1928 data showed the sea level rising at a rate of 0.12 inches per year. The rate tripled around 1929 when the horses began diving. When the shows were suspended from 1945 to 1953, sea level fell at a rate of 0.06 inches per year. When the diving resumed, the sea level rose again at a rate of 0.16 inches per year.
4 ISCCP-FD and GEWEX-SRB radiation products, as they were available until about December 2005 (!) at TOA and at the surface, were simply compared. We found two major errors which need firstly to be removed completely:
4 While the fit is meaningless, I think that there is a decent possibliity that the Wahl and Ammann no-PC regression could become a statistical classic as one of the most remarkable examples of overfitting that I??ve encountered.
4 Petition to President Putin: Kyoto Not Based on Sound Science
4 To listen to the United States' primary agency responsible for monitoring the climate, one would think the end is near as global temperatures continue to rise at an alarming rate. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ( NOAA ) own monitoring network specifically designed to monitor global warming contradicts these claims.
4 ?There is no scientific consensus? on sea-level rise, say scientists
4 The textbooks in question dont deny human-caused global warming is happening; they just accurately report scientists are still debating the question. They present the evidence and ask the students to make up their own minds.
4 There isnt enough data to say with any certainty what will happen to sea levels around the world this century, and there is no scientific consensus to suggest that the rate of the seas rise will accelerate dangerously.
4 Steve my point is that the Cook et al. study is hopelessly confused as well as being largely irrelevant to the complex questions that are raised by the idea of (human-caused) climate change. As to being confused, in one place the paper claims to be exploring the level of scientific consensus that human activity is very likely causing most of the current GW and yet the headline conclusion is based on rating abstracts according to whether humans are causing global warming. These are two entirely different judgements . The irrelevance is because none of the most contentious policy responses to climate change are resolved *even if* we accept that 97.1% of climate scientists believe that human activity is very likely causing most of the current GW (which of course is not what the study has shown). And more broadly, the sprawling scientific knowledge about climate and its changes cannot helpfully be reduced to a single consensus statement, however carefully worded. The various studies such as Cook et al that try to enumerate the climate change consensus pretend it can and that is why I find them unhelpful and, in the sprit of this blog, I would suggest too that they are not helpful for our fellow citizens.
4 Hamilton dutifully says science is all about evidence , not opinions, but he bows to the fake UN Gods of climate, and doesnt seem to notice the irony that the evidence he cites is just a consensus of climate scientists. Somehow it escapes him that a consensus is made of ... opinions? Hamilton rages about the War on Science , but doesnt acknowledge that hes the one who wages it.
4 Mike Hulme: Nuccitelli "97% consensus article is poorly conceived, poorly designed and poorly executed"
4 More up-to-date reconstructions such as "alarmist" Moberg et al. (up) and "skeptic" Loehle (down) don't look like hockey sticks and they don't show any statistically significant "unprecedented changes" in the industrial era.
4 According to real scientists, the graph also gave extreme weighting to datasets that showed unusual 20 th -century warming at the expense of those that did not. And the program that Mr Mann created to draw the graph would have shown the 20 th century as unusually warm even if random red noise rather than real-world data were fed in. There were numerous other statistical curiosities. Mr Manns graph is perhaps the most laughable and widely-discredited object in the history of bad science supporting worse politics.
4 This one is an absolute 100%, 24-carat gold-plated, gimme for Monckton. The UN Panel??s graph is the infamous ???Hockey stick??. Those that still try to defend it (apart from it??s creators) either haven??t acquainted themselves with the facts or simply don??t understand them. The hockey stick is a reconstruction based on tree ring data which claims to shows the climate history over the past several centuries. There are a number of things wrong with it, but the main case against it is that:-
4 Their non-dendro network uses some data with the axes upside down, e.g. Korttajarvi sediments, which are also compromised by agricultural impact (Tiljander, pers. comm.)
4 Treering proxy temperature measurements from Yamal have a pronounced upturn that helps to create a hockey stick shape with the blade rising in the 20th Century. These were used in Kaufman 2009 to show the Arctic apparently warming fast after 2000 years of steady cooling. This warming starts after thermometer records started. The pattern should therefore show in the thermometer records, especially around Yamal. But it does not.
4 First, here is Figure 1, entitledHockey stick graph of rising global temperatures. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that the Figure goes to 1998 or so,and that it grafts the instrumental record after 1902 onto the proxy record before 1901, with the grafting not mentioned in the caption.
4 Unfortunately Die Zeit forgot to mention that the hockey stick had been debunked thoroughly by Steven McIntyre and Hans von Storch, who labelled the hockey stick chart nonsense, and that Andrew Montford wrote an entire book about the fraud: The Hockey Stick Illusion . They also failed to mention that the National Academy of Sciences had also called Manns methodology flawed.
4 Global warming science nemesis Steve McIntyre of the solid Climate Audit site calls the new paper by Rahmstorf and Mann making claims about Atlantic Ocean currents based on proxies rather than onmeasurements much worse than we thought .
4 Thanks for the reply. Ive seen the Jacoby-dArrigo references and, in fact, thats what occasioned my interest. It was included in their northern treeline index which seemed a little odd to me, since the site is far from the treeline. I also notice that the earliest portion of the chronology (not used by Jacoby and dArrigo) is based only on one tree. If you were doing the chronology today, would you include the portion based on only one tree in your site chronology? Also do you know (from past notes or otherwise) any details about potential logging or other forestry operations in the area?
4 Jaworowski illustrates this by comparing ice core data to other CO2 proxy data, such as stomata indices, which gives higher atmospheric CO2, with more variation than the ice core data over the last 8,000 years.
4 i.e. therefore tree rings are useless as a proxy to show that 20th Century temperature rises are unprecedented, and that there was no Medieval Warm Period, since they apparently dont respond to increases in temperature.
4 Even though his work was as dodgy as anyones I feel sorry for Briffa at times. He appears to develop a kind of Stockholm Syndrome towards the hectoring Mann. In his heart he is well aware of the flaws in Manns research and in the early years he is capable of mutiny. 1024334440 , 2002. I am sick to death of Mann stating his reconstruction represents the tropical area just because it contains a few (poorly temperature representative ) tropical series. He is just as capable of regressing these data again any other target series , such as the increasing trend of self-opinionated verbage he has produced over the last few years , and (better say no more). Cook sympathises: Of course, I agree with you. We both know the probable flaws in Mikes recon, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff. It is puzzling to me that a guy as bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit more objectively.
4 Leaving that aside, did Mann get it right? . There is no doubt that reconstructing past temperatures from proxy data is fraught with danger. Take tree ring records. They sometimes reflect rain or drought rather than temperature. They also get smaller as a tree gets older so annual or even decadal detail is lost.
4 In Mr. Wigleys view at the time, ice cores were unreliable and correlate very poorly with temperature. He said the link between ice core and temperature variation was close to zero and tree rings were less than 50% reliable. The main external candidate is solar, and more work is required to improve the paleo solar forcing record. Another U.S. scientist, Gary Funkhauser of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona, was also cool to the idea of tree rings as indicators of past temperatures. He wrote in September, 1996, that he tried every trick out of my sleeve to get meaningful climate records out of certain tree ring records collected by Russian scientist Stephan Shiyatov.
4 *Paleoclimate reconstructions capture quite well moderate long term variability of 50 years and more but fail to pick up the much more variable decadal variability
4 The process quickly gets complicated when proxies from many areas are brought together to map out ancient climate trends for a region. Because different proxies yield varying pictures of changes through time, some paleoclimate maps can look vague and generalized. It's also a matter of having enough computer power to handle not only the data, but to incorporate it with the oceanic, atmospheric, and other models, says Hughes.
4 Aside from solving the various crossword puzzles, the more fundamental issue is: is this a valid way of adjusting the Mannian PC1? Does it make any sense to try to adjust the PC1 (as opposed to the individual chronologies)? What if the growth pulse in the bristlecones was not related to CO2 fertilization ??? an effect denied by other writers in the field?
4 The blink comparator below shows the huge changes which have been made to the US temperature record since 1999. The past has been massively cooled, and the present has been massively warmed. A cooling trend has been turned into a warming trend, by adjusting the data.
4 Indeed, the preponderance of evidence from the officially manipulated temperature datasets indicates fabricated cooling adjustments being applied to periods pre-1980 and a fabricated warming since 1980.
4 Putting these two graphs side by side, you can see huge differences. What is going on? Why does NIWAs graph show strong warming, but graphing their own raw data looks completely different? Their graph shows warming, but the actual temperature readings show none whatsoever!
4 By these calculations (averaging the trend at each site) the raw trend is 0.35 degrees C per 100 years, and the state trend is 0.83C. Thats a warming bias of 133%!
4 Official Fake Temperatures By Climate Agencies: The Temperature Fabrication Issue Bigger Than Thought
4 Earths temperature system cannot be adequately measured or controlled. Mathematical criteria devised in the 1960s that ensure a system is measurable, observable and controllable are not satisfied.
4 A different way of looking at this is to normalize the two graphs to 1978, showing how they have massively cooled the past.
4 Remember this is 11 years after Hansen??s comments of certainty to the Senate and five years after the 1995 IPCC Report. It is worse now with fewer weather stations and less data than in 1990.
4 And this is why I have no doubt that most of what we see in the global temperature is just fractal noise. And here are some other important properties of fractal noise:
4 The blue line is how Hansen currently shows Phoenix a sharp warming trend. Apparently the UHI effect in Phoenix has disappeared since he wrote his 1999 paper. He cooled the past by about a degree and warmed the present by almost that much.
4 Several oddities have turned up, unexpected variations which seem to have a pattern relating to station and station geographical location. Some of this may be related to UHI and similar thermal mass / water effects.
4 If people reading iPhones can spot such problems and know the temperature data isn??t valid, and a citizen run CWOP program can use MADIS analysis of the data sight unseen and note it??s FUBAR, why can??t our meteorological experts at The Weather Channel figure it out?
4 Climate realists are generally willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Earth has warmed somewhat in recent decades. In fact, though, it is not obvious that even this modest claim is true. Satellite data show no net warming for as long as such data have been collected, i.e., back to 1979. Ocean measurements show no net warming over that period, either; the evidence for warming is based on land measurements. But the accuracy of land measurements depends on proper siting and maintenance of weather stations. One obvious factor is the urban heat island effect: many weather stations are located in cities, which grow warmer as more people and buildings accumulate. Thus, increasing temperatures at such stations may be measuring urban development rather than the climate. We all know that the urban heat island effect is realchance of frost in outlying areasyet the data that alarmists rely upon do not take it into account.
4 The adjustments do seem to be very aggressive in identifying any effects that might have artificially created a cooling trendbut lax in finding and correcting effects that mighthave artificially created a warming trend. First and foremost, the changing urban heat island effect in growing cities seems to be under-corrected (Again there is debate on this -- the proprietors of the model believe they have fixed this with a geographic normalizing, correcting biases from nearby thermometers. I and others believe all they are doing is mathematically smearing the error over a larger geography).
4 Weather stations can no longer be trusted. 90% of the 1,064 weather stations do not meet government standards because contamination is present.
4 But this comment, although it appeared, is now lost in the barrage. And Michael Getner, the PBS ombudsman, is backpedalling the role PBS played in allowing Watts to speak to their viewers. But as they say, when you are taking flak, it means youre over the target. Anthony Watts, through ordinary careful data collation and analysis, threatens the standing of NOAAs assertions about the integrity and accuracy of U.S. temperature records, and that has the alarmosphere in apoplexy.
4 In 1980, a paper by a senior New Zealand meteorologist (JWD Hessell), which was peer-reviewed and published in a reputable science journal, concluded that there was no evidence of New Zealand warming since 1930. The author found that the raw data overstated the extent of warming because thermometers had been affected by shelter, screenage and urbanisation. This directly contradicts the Salinger thesis.
4 The sooner these simple facts are acknowledged by responsible journalists the sooner reason will return to this important matter of public interest. Kiwis deserve to have a national temperature record they can trust but at the moment it is dubious.
4 Furthermore, Hansens models predicted the temperature rise if human carbon dioxide emissions were cut back drastically starting in 1988, such that by year 2000 the atmospheric carbon dioxide level was not rising at all. But in reality, the temperature did not even rise that much. Which proves that the climate models dont have a clue about the effect of carbon dioxide on world temperature.
4 Moreover (and you wont find this in the Academy paper), even if you believe, wrongly, that 2014 was the hottest year on record, 2014 was yet another year where the deviation widened between the models hot forecasts and the actual cooler temperatures.
4 The figure is scientifically meaningless. A statistical distribution can be calculated over the results from the some 73 global climate models, but the models have never been validated and only one valid model would have been sufficient. As discussed above, the models have significant, unknown, internal uncertainty. Further, CO2 emissions do not explain the significant warming of the first part of the 20 th century, the current pause in warming of at least a decade (in the atmosphere and at least 15 years on the surface) and the regional nature of the of the warming, which is occurring in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere with little warming elsewhere.
4 Lee et al.s controlled experiment (climate model) showed increased flow through the Indonesian Throughflow during the 2007/08 and 2008/09 La Nias. This is basically the explanation for why the ocean heat content of the Indian Ocean did not cool proportionally during those La Nias. Note, however, in Figure 3 that the ocean heat content of the Indian Ocean did drop during the 2005/06 La Nia, which seems to contradict Lee et al.s model. The Lee et al. model also did not appear to respond to the 1998-01 La Nia, while the data indicate the warming of the Indian Ocean actually began then, after a drop a few years earlier.
4 Claim C: On its face, the climate model assumptions (including high positive feedbacks) of substantial warming from small changes in CO2 are inconsistent with relatively modest past warming. Scientists use what is essentially an arbitrary plug variable to handle this, assuming anthropogenic aerosols have historically masked what would be higher past warming levels. The arbitrariness of the plug is obvious given that most models include a cooling effect of aerosols in direct proportion to their warming effect from CO2, two phenomenon that should not be linked in nature, but are linked if modelers are trying to force their climate models to balance. Further, since aerosols are short lived and only cover about 10% of the globes surface in any volume, nearly heroic levels of cooling effects must be assumed, since it takes 10C of cooling from the 10% area of effect to get 1C cooling in the global averages.
4 Each of the complex climate models used by the IPCC grossly overstates the amount of warming the planet has experienced during the past 120 or so years. In addition, based on the idea that temperatures should rise right along with CO 2 emissions, these models have missed the entire 18+ year hiatus in rising temperatures.
4 In order to take precautions, you have to know what you are taking them against. Some computer models project that the global temperature in ten years time will be warmer than todays. Other computer modelsproject that global temperature will be cooler ten years hence. Read more here .
4 In summing up their discussion of the subject, therefore, Laxon et al. simply state that their results ???show that errors are present in current simulations of Arctic sea ice,?? and they thus conclude, in the closing sentence of their paper, that ???until models properly reproduce the observed high-frequency, and thermodynamically driven, variability in sea ice thickness, simulations of both recent, and future, changes in Arctic ice cover will be open to question.??
4 In September, 2008, Der Spiegel here wrote: More heat waves, no snow in the winter: After years of calculation work, the climate prognoses of the German government are complete. With unprecedented accuracy they predict how the climate will change by the year 2100 region by region. Unfortunately the unprecedented accuracy theyve seen up to nowis not what they had in mind.
4 The geophysicist slammed the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), saying their stand on global warming is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity.
4 The evidence, therefore, indicates that the current generation of climate models (when run as a group, with the CMIP5 prescribed forcings) do not reproduce the observed global warming over the past 20 years, or the slowdown in global warming over the past fifteen years.
4 Notice that the potential positive bias in model feedbacks can, in some sense, be attributed to a lack of model complexity compared to the real climate system. By complexity here I mean cloud variability which is not simply the result of a cloud feedback on surface temperature. This lack of complexity in the model then requires the model to have positive feedback built into it (explicitly or implicitly) in order for the model to agree with what looks like positive feedback in the observations.
4 It is also the scenario which, when fed into the worlds climate models, produces the greatest warming by the end of the centuryabout 4.5C (although the world abounds with observations that suggests that this temperature rise is overblown, but that is the subject of a different analysis).
4 Climate Models: On the Global Warming Policy Foundation blog, David Whitehouse discusses the failure of the IPCC to discard models that clearly have no predictive value. The average of the models used greatly overestimate the increase in temperatures from additional CO2. The continued use of these models illustrates a failure in IPCC methodology procedures. Discarding models that greatly overestimate warming would result in a significant reduction in the upper bound of climate sensitivity estimates. Such action would render many climate issues, such as species extinction, moot. The huge amounts of money provided by climate alarm would shrink, endangering many climate researchers.
4 So, even with all of 140 cherries picked, we still see evidence there is something wrong with the IPCC models in general. And I believe the problem is they are too sensitive, and thus are predicting too much future global warming.
4 why cant climate models properly simulate sea ice losses in the Arctic Ocean or sea ice gains in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica?
4 The overall picture is clear. Scenario A is the emissions scenario from 1990 that is closest to the observed emissions outturn, and yet there has only been a third of a degree of global warming since 1990 about half of what the IPCC had then predicted with what it called substantial confidence.
4 Storch: If things continue as they have been, in five years, at the latest, we will need to acknowledge that something is fundamentally wrong with our climate models. A 20-year pause in global warming does not occur in a single modeled scenario. But even today, we are finding it very difficult to reconcile actual temperature trends with our expectations.
4 While this might sound reasonable, it turns out that the radiative signature of forcing is much larger than that of feedback. As a result, one can get pretty good agreement between models and observations even when the model feedbacks are greatly in error. Another way of saying this is that you can get good agreement between the model behavior and observations whether the cloud feedbacks are positive OR negative. This is another fact I will be demonstrating on December 16.
4 The authors compared recently constructed temperature data sets from Antarctica, based on data from ice cores and ground weather stations, to 20th century simulations from computer models used by scientists to simulate global climate. While the observed Antarctic temperatures rose by about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius) over the past century, the climate models simulated increases in Antarctic temperatures during the same period of 1.4 degrees F (0.75 degrees C).
4 ???observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations?? which the authors state are ???however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models??
4 The group, which includes seven Apollo astronauts and two former directors of NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston, are dismayed over the failure of NASA, and specifically the Goddard Institute For Space Studies (GISS), to make an objective assessment of all available scientific data on climate change. They charge that NASA is relying too heavily on complex climate models that have proven scientifically inadequate in predicting climate only one or two decades in advance.
4 The models systematically underestimate dust emission, transport and optical depth, and year-to-year changes in these properties bear little resemblance to observations, the authors wrote. These findings cast doubt on the ability of these models to simulate the regional climate and the response of African dust to future climate change.
4 Read here and here . Climate models are dependent on atmospheric relative humidity staying constant if CO2 increases are going to cause global temperatures to increase. Again, real world evidence proves models are wrong.
4 Twenty-eight million weather balloons had shown by 1999 that the key assumption in the climate models was wrong. Without feedbacks, the models only produce 1.2C of warming with a doubling of CO2. With feedbacks the simulations ramp that up to a dangerous 3 ??? 4 degrees C, and water vapor was the most important feedback. It??s just no fun for the Global Worriers without it.
4 These studies arebasedon models, ofwhich only a portion of which represent basic physics (e.g. the pressure gradient force, advection and the universal gravitational constant), with the remainder of the physics parameterized withtunedengineeringcode (e.g see ).
4 The two main points here are (1) the observations are much cooler than the mid-range of the model spread and are at theminimum of the model simulations and (2) the satelliteadjustment for surface comparisons is exceptionally good. The implication of (1) is that the best estimates of the IPCC models are too warm, or that they are too sensitive to CO2 emissions.
4 The Zombie in the room here is the dead science being revived endlessly by Brown and the IPCC, despite the evidence that climate models are based on flawed assumptions, which we know from 28 million weather balloons , 3000 ARGO buoys , 800,000 years of ice cores , and 30 years of satellites .
4 I think what they mean is that this is a somewhat implausible post-hoc rationalisation of the failure of the models to conform to reality; perhaps the copyeditor missed it.
4 The extended calculation using coupled runs confirms the earlier inference from the AMIPruns that underestimating the negative feedback from cloud albedo and overestimating the positive feedback from the greenhouse effect of water vapor over the tropical Pacific during ENSO is a prevalent problem of climate models.
4 The references here independently show that core model assumptions are wrong. Models assume that relative humidity will stay the same over the tropics as the world warms, that clouds are a positive feedback and not a negative one, and that cloud changes are a feedback and not a forcing in their own right. These are three critical and demonstrable errors.
4 Modeled versus observed correlations with time from 1982 to 2011 are shown in the following two maps. The scale below each map is correlation coefficient, not temperature. A positive correlation coefficient of 1.0 (hot pink) would indicate an area warmed linearly from 1982 to 2011, while a negative correlation coefficient of -1.0 (purple) would indicate an area cooled linearly over that period. Basically, what the maps are showing are the modeled and observed warming and cooling trend patterns. There are no similarities. Keep those two images in mind the next time you see a peer-reviewed paper that projects regional climate on decadal or multidecadal bases. The modelers have no hope of doing so unless they can predict ENSO and its impacts on regional sea surface and land surface temperatures. They simulate both poorly.
4 However, there is absolutely no evidence that the upper end climate models are anywhere close to being right.
4 Perhaps the trade-winds are affecting the climate. But what drives the trade-winds? The models cant predict the trade-winds until they understand what drives them. If it turns out to be cloud cover changes, or lunar orbits, or solar magnetic effects, cosmic ray effects, or all of the above that means there is another whole factor or lots of them that the models did not include. Every warming factor added to the models reduces the power of CO2 as a driver. How much does this reduce your future projections by? (Or your future job prospects?)
4 The models perform poorly in the North Pacific (Figure 16) and in the South Pacific (Figure 17), more than doubling the observed warming rates.
4 The simulation of clouds in climate models remains challenging. There is very high confidence that uncertainties in cloud processes explain much of the spread in modelled climate sensitivity. However, the simulation of clouds in climate models has shown modest improvement relative to models available at the time of the AR4, and this has been aided by new evaluation techniques and new observations for clouds. Nevertheless, biases in cloud simulation lead to regional errors on cloud radiative effect of several tens of watts per square meter.
4 This report relates to climate change scenarios based on computer modelling. Models involve simplifications of the real processes that are not fully understood. Accordingly, no responsibility is accepted by the CSIRO for the accuracy of forecasts or predictions inferred from this report or for any persons interpretations, deductions, conclusions or actions in reliance on this report.
4 Climate models are portrayed by the media and by political entities like the IPCC as splendid tools for forecasting future climate. The climate science community, however, is well aware that climate models are deeply flawed. Rarely, if ever, are the models chronic problems presented to the public and policymakers. In this post, I cited scientific studies that showed that the models are flawed at simulating, for example:
4 The two main points here are (1) the observations are much cooler than the mid-range of the model spread and are at the minimum of the model simulations and (2) the satellite adjustment for surface comparisons is exceptionally good. The implication of (1) is that the best estimates of the IPCC models are too warm, or that they are too sensitive to CO2 emissions.
4 Climate models are unable to replicate the observed behavior in the patterns of changes in the daily temperature range. Instead, the models warm daily high temperatures too fastprobably because they dont account properly for cloud dynamics.
4 The left panel shows the models predictions to 2050. The right panel shows the discrepancy of half a Celsius degree between prediction and reality since 2005.
4 * Continuing scientific dispute exists over whether observations are confirming or disconfirming key short-run predictions of climate models such as an increase in tropospheric water vapor and an increase in tropical tropospheric surface temperatures relative to tropical surface temperatures;
4 Computer simulations of the climate, referred to as general circulation models (GCMs), can be used to assess the sensitivity of climate to changes that might result from increased greenhouse gases. However, because physical feedbacks between Earths atmosphere (including clouds), the ocean, and the biosphere remain incomplete in the models, their use as a tool is limited.
4 The most important measure of model skill is of course its ability to predict previously unmeasured (or unnoticed) phenomena or connections in ways that are more accurate than some simpler heuristic. Many examples exist, from straightforward predictions (ahead of time) of the likely impact of the Pinatubo eruption (Hansen et al 1992), the skillful projection of the last three decades of warming (Hansen et al 1988; Hargreaves 2010) and correctly predicting the resolution of disagreements between different sources of observation data e.g., between ocean and land temperature reconstructions in the last glacial period (Rind and Peteet 1985), or the satellite and surface temperature records in the 1990s (Mears et al 2003; Thorne et al 2011). Against this must be balanced predictions that did not match subsequent observationsfor instance the underestimate of the rate of Arctic sea ice loss in CMIP3 (Stroeve et al 2007).
4 The successful launch of this new atmospheric monitoring system and its detailed diagnosis of clouds will be a very important achievement. The need for this data shows that the understanding and skillful prediction of the climate system has more uncertainties than has been recognized in multi-decadal climate projections, such as reported by the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments.
4 Imagine that! No consensus , not even in terms of the sign of the longwave cloud feedback. Perhaps the GCMs really are cursed. And to rid existing models of that possibility, Huang concludes his paper by stating that "more studies are still required to understand how clouds modify global warming, even with regard to the longwave aspect alone."
4 Aside from that, I think some of the criticism is a bit exaggerated. But it really depends on what you want to look at. Some models are worse than others, but there are some models which are used in seasonal prediction and are able to provide some description of ENSO albeit with biases. My own analysis of various GCMs also suggest that they reproduce the characteristics of the NAO too.
4 5. These results are the sensitivity of the models with respect to their own outputs , not the sensitivity of the real earth. It is their internal sensitivity.
4 I don??t know if the authors used NCAR-PCM or NCAR-CCSM3. But note that NCAR-CCSM3 shows more warming than typical of models. I would suggest that if NCAR-CCSM3 was chosen, one might need to take the projections about impact of farming with a grain of salt. That said: it??s possible precipitation is the greater effect and my comparison of models shown above can??t tell us anything about that.
4 Is it really possible that the simple no-change forecast of 21st Century temperatures is better than the IPCC projections from expensive and complex computer models?
4 Pat Michaels is in San Francisco this week attending the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and presenting a poster detailing the widening mismatch between observations of the earths temperature and climate model projections of its behavior. Since most global warming concern (including that behind regulatory action) stems from the projections of climate models as to how the earths temperature will evolve as we emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels to produce energy), it is important to keep a tab on how the model projections are faring when compared with reality. That they are faring not very well should be more widely knownPat will spread the word while there.
4 However, it should be understood that RCMs operate under a set of boundary conditions set by whatever GCM is being used. Hence, if the GCM does not do an adequate job of reproducing the climate signal of a particular region, the RCM will simply mimic those inaccuracies and biases, and propagate the uncertainties even further, albeit at a regional scale.
4 Even when climate alarmists cheat by cherry-picking the data they use to show climate models are consistent with observed temperatures, their efforts fail. John Christy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville shows climate models project from 157 percent to 297 percent more warming than has been recorded by any data set in the global mid-troposphere where the models indicate greenhouse gases should amplify warming the most. Models projected 230 percent more warming than the median value of the combined observational data sets. READ MORE
4 World leaders are making critical decisions based upon predictions of General Circulation Models or Global Climate Models GCMs) that humans are causing global climate change or global warming. Global climate models attempt to describe the earth's climate and are used in variety of applications. These include the investigation of the possible causes of climate change and the simulation of past and future climates. But these models are limited in important ways.
4 As they describe it, they explored "the potential skill of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) decadal hindcasts from 9 GCMs and their ensembles over the period 1960-2010 from a hydrological perspective." And what did they thereby find? Quoting them again, they say that "the CMIP5 decadal simulations of rainfall exhibit very low skill when assessed across Australia and across a range of time-scales from yearly to longer which extend to the entire decade." And it is this finding that leads them to ultimately conclude that the current state of precipitation predictability "is not enough to drive impact models at decadal timescales and to influence policy and decision making."
4 Dr Benny Peiser, of Lord Lawsons Global Warming Policy Foundation, argued todays report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is based on flawed models which do not give an accurate prediction of a future change in temperature.
4 Uncertainty about important feedback mechanisms is one reason why the ultimate goal of climate modeling forecasting reliably the future of key variables such as temperature and rainfall patterns is not realizable.
4 Too, we dont have accurate actual measurements of all locations, levels, and components (like temperature, moisture, wind speed, and so on) of the atmosphere, land, ocean (and outer space). The number of measurements we do have is minuscule compared to the actual size of the earth. So it is hard to reconcile the output of models with what the actual state of the earth is, though, of course, this is a necessary step. The process whereby the models are adjusted so that they conform to both the actual measurements and to the scientists expectations is called tuning . All models undergo extensive tuning until the majority of it users are satisfied of the output.
4 In his book, Climate Change: A Natural Hazard, William Kininmonth, former head of Australias National Climate Centre says, The simple one-dimensional energy balance model used by the IPCC to justify its radiative forcing hypothesis is unrealistic in its portrayal of processes at the earth-atmosphere interface. The IPCC model suggests that the heat and latent energy exchange between the underlying surface and the atmosphere is a direct response to the imbalance of solar energy and terrestrial radiation at the surface. Such a proposal is at odds with the physics of the surface energy exchange processes. Its one of many errors made to achieve a result; actions that are the opposite of even poor science.
4 The first peer reviewed study determines that today's climate models will never be able to predict the climate. Essentially, climate models assume linear climate relationships yet the real-world climate is non-linear and chaotic - defying intermediate and long-term predictive "expertise" with predictable regularity.
4 In the absence of model verification or falsification, Stainforth et al. (2007) describes the challenges of building confidence in climate models. Owing to the long time scales present, particularly in the ocean component, there is no possibility of atrue cycle of model improvement and confirmation, particularly since the life cycle of an individual model version (order of a few years) is substantially less than the simulation period (order of centuries). Model projections of future climate states relate to a state of the system that has not been previously experienced. Hence it is impossible to calibrate the model for the future climate state or confirm the usefulness of the forecast.
4 Most of the fundamental problems in our still immature understanding of climate have remained unresolved for decades. Some cannot be resolved at all. The U.N.?s climate panel admitted in 2001 what has been known for 50 years: Because climate is a ?coupled, non-linear, chaotic object,? reliable long-term climate prediction is impossible.
4 I welcome articles from you that show the IPCC models have skill on the multi-decadal time periods. Until you (or others) do, all the IPCC-type models can tell us is that the climate system is sensitive to the addition of CO2, other greenhouse gases, aerosols and land use/land cover change. We do not need a multi-hundred million dollar modeling program to provide regional and local impact scenarios when the models have shown no skill at doing this on multi-decadal time scales (even when run in a hindcast mode).
4 However, for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012, only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3 trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend. Applying the standard 5% statistical critical value, we conclude that the model projections are inconsistent with the recent observed global warming over the period 1998- 2012.
4 ???To date, not one of theirs and other computer models proving global warming have been accurate.?? ??? Alan Caruba
4 A paper published today in the Journal of Climate finds that ensembles of climate models used by the IPCC to predict future climate change"may lead to overly confident climate predictions." The authors find that many models share the same computer code, have the same limitations, and "tend to be fairly similar," resulting in confirmation bias. Indeed, empirical observations have shown far less warming than the "90% confident" IPCC models in AR4, as shown in this poster by John Christy:
4 Given the inadequacies of current climate models, how should we interpret the multi-model ensemble simulations of the 21 st century climate used in the IPCC assessment reports? This ensemble-of-opportunity is comprised of models with generally similar structures but different parameter choices and calibration histories. McWilliams (2007) and Parker (2010) argue that current climate model ensembles are not designed to sample representational uncertainty in a thorough or strategic way. Stainforth et al. (2007) argue that model inadequacy and an inadequate number of simulations in the ensemble preclude producing meaningful probability density functions (PDFs) from the frequency of model outcomes of future climate. Nevertheless, as summarized by Parker (2010), it is becoming increasingly common for results from individual multi-model and perturbed-physics simulations to be transformed into probabilistic projections of future climate, using Bayesian and other techniques. Parker argues that the reliability of these probabilistic projections is unknown, and in many cases they lack robustness. Knutti et al. (2008) argues that the real challenge lies more in how to interpret the PDFs rather whether they should be constructed in the first place. Stainforth et al. (2007) warns against over interpreting current model results since they could be contradicted by the next generation of models, undermining the credibility of the new generation of model simulations.
4 Trying to take the planetary energy balance equationand torture it into something that it was never intended to do is pointless and misleading at best. The planetary energy balance equation is the simplest possible climate model. On the other hand there are the general circulation global climate models, which are of enormous complexity. In between is a whole class of energy balance climate models, which were very popular in the 1950s 1980s, the Wikipedia gives a good introduction to this class of models, which includes box models, radiative-convective models, higher dimension versions of the zero-dimensional planetary energy balance model, and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (statistical/dynamical models). Different models can be used depending the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales.
4 Model simulations are able to show how a possible future might look like. However, it is very difficult regionally to make reliable conclusions as we run against the limits of what is possible with climate models today. You can only fathom the possibilities.
4 We couldnt say it any better once again, the real world is not cooperating with expectations from predictions from numerical climate models for a world of never-seen-before environmental conditions resulting from ever-increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
4 In his new paper, Lovejoy applies the same approach to the 15-year period after 1998, during which globally averaged temperatures remained high by historical standards, but were somewhat below most predictions generated by the complex computer models used by scientists to estimate the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions.
4 And the NRC reminds us that there are other fundamental uncertainties as well. There is a "wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions of global climate change" that can only be reduced by "major advances in understanding and modeling" of greenhouse gas emissions, the role of aerosols in the global climate system, and the incredibly complex "feedback" mechanisms in the Earth's climate.
4 The models say the Earth system ought to accrue energy at the rate of 3W/m 2 . Instead the best estimate we have of recent energy balance suggests we??ve been losing energy at a rate of about 0.1 W/m 2 (Knox and Douglass 2010). The models don??t match the observations.
4 Simulations using several IPCC-class general circulation models (GCMs) are used to demonstrate that the adjustment to climate change itself takes place over decadal timescales, meaning that ENSO response is not statistically significant during the 21st century. This implies that current model intercomparisonexperiments are insufficient to measure the true range of ENSO climate sensitivity. However, significant changes to atmospheric teleconnectionsmay take place within the 21st century: the NCARCommunity Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), for example, predicts harsher winters in the Southwestern US during La Nia and weaker Australian teleconnections during both El Nio and La Nia.
4 3) Chaotic Uncertainty. It is well understood that climate is a chaotic object and climate models reflect that property. The outcome of a particular model run (???simulation??) depends sensitively on the initial conditions; even minute changes can lead to greatly differing outcomes. For example, the five runs of a Japanese MRI model show temperature trends that differ by almost a factor of 10, an order of magnitude. (If more runs had been performed, the spread would have been even greater.) One can show that taking the mean of an ensemble of more than 10 runs leads to an asymptotic value for the trend. However, most modelers face constraints on time and money and are not able to carry out so many runs. For example, of the 22 models in the IPCC compilation of ???20 CEN?? there are 5 single run models, 5 two-run models, and only 7 models with four or more runs.
4 When the data sets are compared to model projections for the tropical mid-troposphere, where climate models say a tropical hot spot should emerge, the models do even worse, overstating the warming by between 169 and 414 percent overestimating the median of the observational data sets for the tropics by 330 percent.
4 Even in the absence of external forcing, climate models often exhibit long-term trends that cannot be attributed to natural variability . This so called climate drift arises for various reasons including: perturbations to the climate system on coupling component models together and deficiencies in model physics and numerics.To illustrate this we have focussed on simulated trends over the second half of the 20th century Below depths of 1000 to 2000m, drift dominates over any forced trend in most regions. As such steric sea-level is strongly affected and for some models and regions the sea-level trend direction is reversed.
4 GoshWhere Did All of Those Expensive Climate Models Go Wrong?
4 Pearce also tries to suggest that forecasting climate change is like forecasting the seasons i.e., easy. Unfortunately, Edward Lorenz proved that claim to be false very nearly half a century ago, in the landmark paper in a climatological journal that founded chaos theory. Lorenz demonstrated that unless we knew the values of the millions of parameters that define the climate to a precision that is not and can never be in practice attainable the long-range prediction of climatic behavior would be impossible by any method. Yet the UNs case for climate alarm is based almost exclusively on the output of models that have been demonstrated, time and again, to fail. Not one of the models on which the UN relies, for instance, had predicted that there would be 15 years without any statistically-significant global warming the years 1995-2009 inclusive.
4 Callaghan and Power's analysis of their lengthy and comprehensive new data base reveals results that appear to be totally at odds with the contentions of the IPCC, which are based more on the output of numerical models of the atmosphere than on real-world observations. And their results also highlight the fact that even real-world observations may be misleading, especially if they do not cover a long enough time period to reveal the oscillatory nature of various aspects of earth's climate. References
4 This is yet another reason why we need to move away from using multi-decadal global climate models as the tool to communicate to policymakers. They are NOT skillful multi-decadal projection tools even in terms of global average radiative forcing.
4 How Have Climate Models Done Predicting Cloud Coverage? Not Too Well
4 Just add sea ice onto the growing list of variables that are simulated poorly by the IPCCs climate models. Over the past few months, weve illustrated and discussed that the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive for the upcoming 5 th Assessment Report (AR5) cannot simulate observed:
4 In the end the authors brand this unsolved mystery the ?Holocene temperature conundrum.? We have heard this song before, usually from climate modelers asking for more grant money to ?improve? their wonky programs. There may be some wiggle room in the interpretation of the proxy data but the new study, M13, is supposed to be the latest and most accurate temperature history available. This points directly back at the models as the weak link in the story. ?If the M13 reconstruction is correct, it will imply major biases across the current generation of climate models,? Liu et al conclude. This is more than just a conundrum for climate scientists?those computer models are the embodiment of climate science's understanding of how climate works here on planet Earth. If the models do not work, climate science has gotten it wrong.
4 I invite anyone to defend this perspective, and we will present as a guest weblog post. From my perspective, if a global climate model cannot simulate current climate, as well as changes in the climate system, accurately it cannot produce accurate projections of climate in the coming decades.
4 The authors write that "how well the CMIP5 GCMs simulate climate at regional scales is of great interest to both researchers and resource managers," because, as they say in stating the obvious, "a model that fails to reproduce aspects of the past climate will be less likely to produce a correct projection of future climate."
4 ??And that strength of models is, if you still do not consider adequately the effect of clouds? They can not explain the polar climate? They can not predict the next hurricane season?
4 The dynamical trends were similar in the observations and the model simu- lations, except that the dynamical effect was much larger in the observations than in both model experiments. In other words, the dynamical effects are clearly present in the state-of-the-art global climate models, but they are much too small to match the data.
4 As for some other specifics, the two researchers determined that (1) "long-term mean vertically integrated cloud fields have quite significant deficiencies in all the CMIP5 model simulations," that (2) "both the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models display a clear bias in simulating too high LWP in mid-latitudes," that (3) "this bias is not reduced in the CMIP5 models," that (4) there have been "little to no changes in the skill of reproducing the observed LWP and CA ," that (5) "inter-model differences are still large in the CMIP5 simulations," and that (6) "there is very little to no improvement apparent in the tropical and subtropical regions in CMIP5."
4 While climate models are supposed to be snapshots of the Earths real climate, the mismatch between observed and modeled climate behavior shows that even the best models are not accurate and are likely overestimating outcomes. Gerald North, a Texas A&M atmospheric sciences and oceanography professor, estimates that climate models overestimate warming by roughly 50 percent.
4 (And what fundamental feedback in the tropical Pacific are climate models still unable to simulate correctly? Thats right: Bjerknes feedback. See Bellenger et al (2013) .)
4 Further, because climate models cant simulate where, when, why and how the ocean surfaces warm and cool around the globe, they cant properly simulate land surface temperatures or precipitation. And if they cant simulate land surface temperatures or precipitation, what value do they have? Quick answer: No value. Climate models are not yet fit for their intended purposes.
4 Once again, these problems with regional impacts studies are just the tip of the iceberg. Climate modelers admit privately that global climate models are not capable of providing accurate predictions of regional climate.
4 comprehensive comparison of characteristics of the planetary albedo () in data from two satellite measurement campaigns (ERBE and CERES) and output from 20 GCMs, simulating the 20th-century climate, is performed. Discrepancies between different data sets and models exist; thus, it is clear that conclusions about absolute magnitude and accuracy of albedo should be drawn with caution. Yet, given the present calibrations, a bias is found between different estimates of , with modelled global albedos being systematically higher than the observed. The difference between models and observations is larger for the more recent CERES measurements than the older ERBE measurements. Through the study of seasonal anomalies and space and time distribution of correaltions between models and observations, specific regions with large discrepancies can be identified. It is hereby found that models appear to over-estimate the albedo during boreal summer and under-estimate it during austral summer. Furthermore, the seasonal variations of albedo in subtropical areas dominated by low stratiform clouds, as well as in dry desert regions in the subtropics, seem to be poorly simulated by the models.
4 This piece is typical of thousands of other news stories about calamities in the Amazon that are immediately blamed on global warming. Other headlines quickly found include Ocean Warming - Not El Nio - Drove Severe Amazon Drought in 2005 or Amazon Droughts Will Accelerate Global Warming or Amazon Could Shrink by 85% due to Climate Change, Scientists Say. Notice that climate change can cause droughts and floods in the Amazon PLUS droughts in the Amazon can cause global warming (by eliminating trees that could uptake atmospheric carbon dioxide). Throughout many of these stories, the words delicate and irreversible are used over and over.
4 Many of these myths were created by proponents of manmade global warming who have no understanding of the coupled ocean-air processes that result in El Nio and La Nia events. Those persons look at an El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index and wrongly assume the index represents all of the processes of ENSOwhen, in reality, the index simply shows the impact of El Nio and La Nia events on the variable being measured for that index. ENSO indices (like NINO3.4 region sea surface temperature anomalies presented in the post) do not capture in recharge aspects of La Nia events that are evident in the ocean heat content data for the tropical Pacific and they do not capture the impacts of the discharge and redistribution processes of major El Nio events that are plainly visible in the sea surface temperature anomalies of the Atlantic-Indian-West Pacific Oceans(90S-90N, 80W-180) .
4 Well, Greenland is a regional phenomenon, the alarmists may claim. We have to look at the entire Northern hemisphere.
4 Read here , here and here . The alarmist AGW hypothesis calls for an increase of atmospheric CO2 to increase atmospheric warming; that will then warm the surface causing increased water evaporation; that will then increase the amount of atmospheric water vapor (the largest greenhouse gas); that will then increase atmospheric warming; that will then warm the Earth's surface; and, etc., in a repeat-the-above scenario of a never-ending positive feedback loop finally leading to the mythical, catastrophic climate tipping points.
4 The IPCC forecast declining winter snow cover and depth due to global warming, once again showing that they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.
4 Nearly every significant statement Gore makes regarding climate science and climate policy is either one sided, misleading, exaggerated, speculative, or just plain wrong. The present OnPoint summarizes my findings.
4 Back in early March, we wrote about how this years cherry blossom peak was predicted to occur a bit later than in 2012March 26-30 instead of March 20-23. While recognizing that later peak blooms in a single year dont prove anything either way about global warming, we still raised the question of press reactionor rather the lack of it. Since the early peak dates in the last three years caused quite a bit of climate alarmism, the same should, theoretically, happen when the peak date is overdue.
4 PHOENIX (Feb. 3, 2010) -- Climate scientist William Sprigg delivered a bold challenge to his fellow climate scientists in a blockbuster address to EUEC 2010 in Phoenix, Arizona on February 2.Sprigg, an adjunct research professor in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona, led the technical review of the first global warming report issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990.In his address to the Thirteenth Annual Energy and Environment Expo, Sprigg took on the ClimateGate scandal and called for "serious reforms" of the global scientific community. He warned of a growing perception that "the IPCC is biased, conflicted, pushing political agendas."Sprigg called for a new climate research agency supported not entirely by the government, but in conjunction with the private sector."We need to stick to our scientific principles," Sprigg said, referring at least in part to the critical importance of sharing data with other scientists so that hypotheses and methodologies can be checked and double-checked. "We need to improve our peer preview process, and expand the stakeholders' role to keep us all honest."Sprigg's remarks were videotaped by Heartland Institute Research Fellow James G. Lakely, attending the conference not generally friendly to skeptics of predictions of catastrophic, man-made global warming.Heartland Senior Fellow James M. Taylor, managing editor of Environment & Climate News, also attended the event, and during the Q&A; following Sprigg's presentation asked the scientist what he thinks the future holds for the IPCC.Sprigg nodded as Taylor referred to "mounting scandals" at the IPCC and then responded, "There will be some reform. I think there's going to be big changes in the peer review process for the IPCC. There will be--there are--calls for the head of Pachauri. Some of my colleagues have written letters saying that he needs to be taken off the job ..."The video is available on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeEIl0-0EOA and also on the Web sites of Environment & Climate News, The Heartland Institute, and Global Warming Facts.
4 There is global climate science and then there is the Global Warming Movement. The movement hijacked the science a long time ago, and it has had its share of setbacks lately. Its leaders have tried to stiff-arm their way past errors, lies, fraud, pointless tax increase proposals and some really peculiar posing in Copenhagen.
4 Johnston cross examines and juxtaposes conclusions from numerous scientists to reveal "a rhetoric of persuasion, of advocacy that prevails throughout establishment climate science"(9). Complexities and uncertainties that might shake the confidence of policymakers are often concealed. For example, there is no mention of water vapor feedbacks in the IPCC AR4 "Climate Science" documents intended to influence the public and the media the Policymaker Summary and Technical Summary (24).
4 Once the UNFCCC treaty was a done deal, the IPCC and its scientific conclusions were set on a track to become a self fulfilling prophecy. The entire framing of the IPCC was designed around identifying sufficient evidence so that the human-induced greenhouse warming could be declared unequivocal, and so providing the rationale for developing the political will to implement and enforce carbon stabilization targets. National and international science programs were funded to support the IPCC objectives.
4 How often do we see this happena press release about a scientific study states or suggests that global warming was the cause of a factor being studied, when the paper itself doesnt come to that conclusionand/or the data contradict it?
4 I first became interested in the topic of Global Warming, as it was known then, almost 6 years ago. The trigger for me was watching Al Gores Inconvenient Truth, and realising that the film was a very powerful narrative which lacked proper balance and was all about advocacy, with references to underlying theory frustratingly vague and infrequent. The cherry-picker scene was kinda sciencey, yet somehow even that aroused questions rather than convincing me. I had no means to evaluate the science aspects back then, so resolved to look into them (wow, armed only with a long-ago physics degree did that take years longer than I thought!) But in fact my chief interest was not the climate science.
4 In the case of the IPCC, they published a flat-out fear-mongering sensitivity that in computer simulations would produce a temperature increase of +6.4 C (pink line) by 2100AD, if CO2 emissions were not stabilized. This incredibly high computer output was designed to scare policymakers and the mainstream media into action.
4 Now they call it change for the IPCC and the warmer fanatics so they can cover all forms of panic about the weather, but we all know its about carbon dioxide as a scary air pollutant that will kill us all.
4 I should make it clear that Im not doubting that CO2 has a positive radiative heating effect in our atmosphere, due to LWIR re-radiation, that is well established by science. What I am saying is that Mr. Gores Climate Reality Project did a poor job of demonstrating an experiment, so poor in fact that they had to fabricate portions of the presentation, and that the experiment itself (if they actually did it, we cant tell) would show a completely different physical mechanism than what actually occurs in our atmosphere.
4 This is a point that is very hard to explain to climate zealots lets call them climate hawks who are reluctant to admit criticism to the debate. Murry sets out his case
4 In recent years, environmentalism seems to have taken a prominent place on the political scene. Many who champion this new "ism" sadly allege that Man is destructive, unnatural, and guilty of destroying the entire planet. The "proofs" used in this respect are based on selected portions of science which, in many cases, are not based on the objectivity of the scientific method of natural sciences (Sanford, 1992).
4 CO2-hysteric Pachauri now has a blog--with a comment section
4 Whatever the reason, it is indeed vastly more difficult to publish results in climate research journals if they run against the tide of politically correct opinion. Which is why most of the sceptic literature on the subject has been forced onto the web, and particularly onto web-logs devoted to the sceptic view of things. Which, in turn, is why the more fanatical of the believers in anthropogenic global warming insist that only peer-reviewed literature should be accepted as an indication of the real state of affairs. They argue that the sceptic web-logs should never be taken seriously by real scientists, and certainly should never be quoted. Which is a great pity. Some of the sceptics are extremely productive as far as critical analysis of climate science is concerned. Names like Judith Curry (chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta), Steve McIntyre (a Canadian geologist-statistician) and blogger Willis Eschenbach come to mind. These three in particular provide a balance and maturity in public discussion that puts many players in the global warming movement to shame, and as a consequence their outreach to the scientifically inclined general public is highly effective. Their output, together with that of other sceptics on the web, is fast becoming a practical and stringent substitute for peer review.
4 Because global warming advocates are much more comfortable arguing #1 than #2, they like to paint skeptics as all denying #1. This makes for a great straw man that is easy to beat, and is aided by the fact that there is a true minority who doesn't believe #1 (and who, despite everything that is written, have every right to continue to express that opinion without fear of reprisal). Actually, even better, they like to avoid defending their position at all and just argue that all skeptics are funded by Exxon.

4 IT used to be common for global warming activists to claim that anyone who disagrees with them must be in the pay of big oil remember Al Gore said this in his documentary An Inconvenient Truth. More recently the accusation has been that anyone who disagrees with them doesnt understand the science and therefore does not have an informed opinion.
4 My diagram above was published on the 8 th February, and counted 29 stations. Paul Homewoods original article on the Arctic of 4 th February lists 19 adjusted sites. If RealClimate had actually read the cited article, they would have known that quotation was false in connection to the Arctic. Any undergraduate who made this mistake in an essay would be failed.
4 The official propaganda mantra at the conference, first suggested by a UK pressure-group last year and now enthusiastically adopted by the UN, was that The Science Is Settled. The zombies, led by the outgoing and incoming conference chairmen, recited this mantra with glazed but increasingly desperate pietism.
4 We can learn from experts like Dr. Griffin how to approach those paradigmatics and wishful thinkers who cling to the GHE. Griffin and his ilk advise we pose mostly open-ended questions and encourage others to face that up to the enduring truth that reality will never precisely be what we think it is; none of us are above false beliefs. Plus, our pride is a basic human flaw that obstructs such open inquiry.
4 The prescriptions put forward by the degrowth crowd, says Bryce, are familiar. Nuclear energy is bad. Genetically modified foods are bad. Coal isnt just bad, its awful. Oil is bad. Natural gasand the process often used to produce it, hydraulic fracturing is bad. And it is no surprise that the Environmental Protection Agencythe most anti-growth governmental agencyhas just announced steps to require the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, a technology that has been in use for more than a half century and one that has unlocked access to vast reserves of natural gas and oil.
4 Alarmists evaluate the health of Arctic ice, bythe minimum extent of the year. They go ballistic if you try to use any other measure. They demand that you dont average over the entire year.
4 Global warming hysteria and the concept of the carbon footprint, in particular, have been debunked many times in this column already. Suffice to say, the ClimateCounts survey commands no credibility here, and consumers who shop based on the survey's recommendations may as well consult with an astrologist to guide their purchasing decisions.
4 As Dr. David Wojick noted in his analysis, The UN IPCC's Artful Bias, "It is as one sided as a legal brief, which it resembles." In our last issue of Cooler Heads we quoted Swedish sea-level expert Nils-Axel Moerner, a professor at Stockholm University and president of the INQUA (International Union of Quaternary Research) Commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution, who said of the report, "It is absolutely remarkable how inferior and one-sided this report is." That is the product of advocacy, not science.
4 Gillard used the terms denier or denial 11 times , pointed words because they carry the connotation of Holocaust denial. The last time that tactic was used in the national debate, after the release of the Bringing Them Home report, it exploded on those who used it.
4 So Gore and company present an interesting new environmental ethic. It's okay, as long as you're "environmentally correct," to burn up tons of fuel jetting off to concerts around the world. But it's a sin to even present the exploration for this oil in a positive light. Talk about an "offset" in priorities.
4 In the introduction of his most recent book, Lawson discusses the peculiar atmosphere of our time, of a time of threat to reason, if not of a time of unreason, when he tells us that, despite the fact that his previous three books didn?t have the slightest problem in finding a publisher (they even had one before they were written), this book was rejected by every British publisher it was offered to. The issue was finally resolved by Peter Mayer, the owner of The Overlook Press in New York who also owns Duckworth Publishers in London, who had the courage to publish the book. Lawson makes an additional important remark (p. 105) when he says that the situation was so bad that ? I quote ? ?I was able to write this book only because my own career is behind me.? (By the way, also the quite youthful and ?fresh? professor Kut lek is already 81 years old.) In the currently prevailing atmosphere, Nigel Lawson sees in the global warming hysteria ?the most oppressive and intolerant form of political correctness in the western world today.?
4 This weekend, rock stars will jet around the world, cars and buses will clog traffic, and elaborate sound stages will be set up to burn massive amounts of fuel to send the message to fans at home that they better conserve their energy or face the allegedly dire threat of global warming.
4 Pissed old hacks have to compete to find the news and interpret it in order to fit with their conflicting world views (or those of their proprietors). Sober environmental journalists all digest the same press handouts. The ony competition is to find new synonyms for catastrophic.
4 A week ago, it emerged that the Oscar-winning film director had put his money where his mouth is by donating $1m of his personal fortune to opponents of Proposition 23, a ballot measure facing voters in California at the coming mid-term elections which would suspend the state's landmark law combating climate change. Supporters of the proposition weren't going to take that lying down, though. On Thursday, they returned fire by releasing a short film that claims to highlight a Titanic-sized gulf between Mr Cameron's somewhat magisterial proclamations regarding the importance of combating climate change, and his actual lifestyle.
4 Belief systems are embraced with no logical basis. For example, environmentalists almost universally believe in the dangers of global warming but also reject the best solution to the problem, which is nuclear power. These two beliefs co-exist based on faith, not reason.
4 Many of these evangelists attempt, not to explain the science, but to scare the population into believing, through dire warnings that we face some kind climatic Judgement Day. Indeed if they are to be believed then we are already seeing signs of judgement because of the sin of burning fossil fuels.
4 Yeah. Right. How about Warming Arctic Climate Melting Glaciers Faster, Raising Ocean Level, Scientist Says . Its vintage NYT from 1947. And Glaciers give hints of weather change . Its NYT again, 1955 (article reports of five decades of retreating glaciers, no less). And heres the link to a 1978 NYT article blaming melting glaciers for beach-side troubles in Rhode Island. Looks like there havent been many decades without a Fear the Glaciers! article on the New York Alarmist Times. And all we get is a its different this time around. Not serious, indeed
4 In its August 13 issue, the New York Times has continued its tradition of peddling bogus global warming scare stories during the late summer silly season. This time the threat isn't anything dramatic like the North Pole melting. "Heat waves come on subtly, raising summer temperatures just a little higher than normal and then receding," opined the Times. "But they kill more people in the United States than all other natural disasters combined."
4 With these words last December 14 , the New Zealand Herald editorial writer signalled his slant. Its a bias towards the official line on global warming. The Herald joins the chorus of activists baying for Western compensation for the third world to answer the allegations of injury by climate.
4 Even the Wall Street Journal breathlessly reported Polar Ice Melt Is Accelerating: Shrinking in Greenland, Antarctica Has Sent Ocean Levels Higher, Study Says. This aint just your typical run-of-the-mill, left of almost everywhere, New York Times or Washington Post global warming alarmist stuff. So it must be true right?
4 Shame on the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun-Times, and the Daily Herald for not even including a short blurb in their newspapers about Heartland's outstanding Fourth International Conference on Climate Change with its distinguished world-wide list of speakers. Sadly the media has taken the politically approved stance that global warming is man-made. As such the media is not about to inform its readers of the thousands of leading scientists around the world who reject global warming. Is it any wonder that newspapers are losing subscribers, when they only tell one side of the story? Kudos to Pajama Media for filming the entire conference!
4 The NY Times text the overall measure of cyclone activity, whether through more intense storms or more frequent storms, had doubled with a one-quarter-degree increase in average global temperature is even more scientifically flawed. Hurricanes respond to the SST conditions in their vicinity, not to a global average metric!
4 So unusual is this attempt actually to meet us in argument, and so venomously ad hominem are Abrahams artful puerilities, delivered in a nasal and irritatingly matey tone (at least we are spared his face he looks like an overcooked prawn) , that climate-extremist bloggers everywhere have circulated them and praised them to the warming skies.
4 The Fourth Report (2007) took special precautions to ensure that no true statement about the climate like this one could ever appear again. Chapter 1 was now entitled Historical Overview of Climate Change Science which dealt exclusively with the FCCC definition of Climate Science. It omitted all mention of conventional meteorology and concealed all the many measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide carried out between 1850 and 1975.
4 White House turns up heat on climate alarm
4 Annan also said: Since IPCC can no longer defend their old analyses in any meaningful manner, it seems they have to resort to an unsupported this is what we think, because we asked our pals having firmly wedded themselves to their politically convenient long tail of high values, their response to new evidence is little more than sticking their fingers in their ears and singing la la la I cant hear you.
4 Based on the IPCCs simulations of 21 st century climate, it seems that rainfall will increase overall in the region (including wintertime snowfall in Tibet), and the IPCC AR4 WGII does not discuss the impact of temperature and evapotranspiration on fresh water resources in this region. The importance of these omissions, inconsistencies or mistakes by the IPCC is amplified by the potential of riparian warfare in this region that supports half of the worlds population.
4 The IPCC, you will recall, is Al Gores co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. And the host over the years of numerous scandals involving fudged and twisted data, cut-and-pastes from student theses, popular magazine articles and green-group press releases and of course the infamous hide the decline in temperatures. This is not just one more scandal, however.
4 I didnt feel very inspired today until I ran across an article on the violence of earths history. I want to write about that now. For those who read my blog regularly, you know that I feel it is clear that the world governments are the primary drivers behind the global warming rhetoric and science. Some day I will post on how the governments are using the scientists but that is a different subject.
4 The IPCC peer review process is not like the one academic journals use, in which reviewers actually have the authority to recommend rejection and require changes; instead it is more like a limited, voluntary public comment process. Since the IPCC gives Lead Authors the sole right to determine content and accept or dismiss comments, it is more like a weblog than an academic report.
4 Who pays? Oh, you guessed it before I told you. The West pays. The third world (UN code: non-Annex-I parties) thinks it will collect, so it will always vote for the UNs insane proposals. But the UNs bureaucrats will actually get all or nearly all the money, and will decide how to allocate what minuscule fraction they have not already spent on themselves. As a senior UN diplomat told me last year, The UN exists for only one purpose: to get more money. That, and that alone, is the reason why it takes such an interest in climate change. The draft says: Developed-country Parties shall provide developing-country Parties with new and additional finance, inter alia through a percentage of the gross domestic product of developed-country Parties. And, of course, The extent of participation by non-Annex-I parties in the global effort to deal with climate change is directly dependent on the level of support provided by developed-country Parties.
4 The fallacious alarmism surrounding the Emperor Penguins imminent extinction can be found in one of Mieslers link to the Center of Biological Diversity. The CBD is the environmental legal outfit that sued the USA to list the polar bear and Emperor as endangered species due CO2 warming. The CBD wrote, The Emperor colony at Terre Adelie in East Antarctica featured in the Academy Award-winning French documentary, March of the Penguins plummeted by more than 50% in the late 1970s during a warm period with little sea ice cover, when adults died en masse. Because the sea ice continues to disintegrate, and the prolonged blizzards cause ongoing chick mortality, the colony has yet to recover.?? And When sea ice breaks up before their chicks have matured and grown their waterproof feathers, chicks that are swept into the ocean are likely to die .
4 The letter goes on to preach the tired environmental-activist mantra listing the results of mans sinful actions like hottest year on record (for less than two-percent of the Earth), wildfires, droughts, and public health outbreaks (all unfortunate but not too atypical).
4 Agreed environmentalism has been around for centuries and one of the major proponents last century was Adolf Hitler. The hijacking of environmentalism by the left wing has caused me to write posts on many different websites, and I think that the dreadlocked Earth mother/Gaia hippies have set back legitimate concerns for the environment by decades.
4 Here . Evidently "Coal Kills Climate". This must be true, because it says so right on the huge banner the protesters brought with them. You might recall that both Al Gore and James Hansen have endorsed this type of civil disobedience against coal-fired power plants. You may also recall this : Gore's home may get some power from solar panels and may use enviro-friendly compact flourescent bulbs but the bulk of the home's power comes from Nashville Electric Service, which gets its power from the Tennessee Valley Authority, which produces most of its power from coal-burning power plants .
4 Utley recently wrote an informative post about the extent to which unfounded alarmism permeates U.S. nuclear policy. In it, he elaborates on the costs of this misplaced fear. He also identifies environmentalist special interests as a key conduit through which is disseminated misinformation about the dangers of radiation. Of course, it will come as no shock to readers of this blog that green groups manufacture alarm as a means of expanding their own influence (See: Warming, Global). Read Utleys entire, excellent post here .
4 I mostly find Earth Day just plain annoying for the rank hypocrisy on display. A state-sponsored religious day of worship, along with all of the 1st Amendment-violating regulations to codify it.
4 For over 20 years, the IPCC has been noisily agitating about an unprecedented rate of global warming at ground level where we all live They told us that a predicted rise in surface temperatures of 3-6C by 2100 had the potential to harm mankind in a myriad of ways. These warnings certainly attracted our attention. They were the bait.
4 Though scientists might indeed say this, not so long ago the same scientists gave scientific reasons for an intimate connection between the poles global warming was going to warm those regions the most, because of their lack of water vapour. They change their tune now that observations show different behaviour (though they dont know why), but for years they were telling us the poles were doomed. Not that Massom mentions it.
4 German science used to be, and is in many areas,still highly regarded worldwide. But in the area of climate science, it has been reduced to politics and masterplanning .
4 It is not that simple to tell who is and who is not a climatologist or an expert on climate change and global warming. Ross McKitrick once said that ?there is no such thing as an ?expert? on global warming, because no one can master all the relevant subjects. On the subject of climate change everyone is an amateur on many if not most of the relevant topics.? (as quoted by R. M. Carter, ?The Futile Quest for Climate Control,? Quadrant, November, 2008, p. 10; online atwww.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2008/451/the-futile-quest-for-climate-control). In his recently published book Climate: The Counter Consensus (2010), Prof. Carter suggests that ?scientists who study climate change come from a wide range of disciplines? which he ?groups into three main categories? (p. 22). He claims that ?most of the scientific alarm about dangerous climate change is generated by scientists in themeteorological and computer modeling group, whereas many (though not all)geological scientists see no cause for alarm when modern climate change is compared with the climate history? (p. 23). This structuring seems to be useful.
4 Many climate experts are scientifically illiterate, and get confused by this graph showing the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and global temperature
4 So then we come to climate science. In normal science, the literally trillions of dollars are NOT on the line. In normal science, theories are provable, money is minimal, and fame comes when you do something truly unique. In climate science, proof of correctness is probably 20 years out as a minimum. There is massive and immediate money on the line, and perks for concluding unprecedented global warming include, huge fame, easier publication, financial rewards, and control over government policy. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the politics of the situation have thoroughly corrupted the science of climate.
4 We see below how many of the UWA hosts benefit from climate change grants, and thus would potentially gain from promoting a baseless smear against critics who threaten their funding or status. These hypocrites are happy to promote the untruth that skeptics are funded to speak, when the they themselves are the ones who benefit financially from a dubious scare campaign. The professors-at-large program is supposed to foster public debate, but four of the ten Oreskes hosts signed a letter seeking to silence a skeptic from speaking at another university.
4 In 1988,Hansenforecast that parts of Manhattan would be underwater by now, and that crime would greatly increase due to global warming.
4 Climate models have been used by the political entity called the IPCC for almost 2 decades to support a political agenda known as the UNFCCC. In those 2 decades, apparently the climate science community hasnt bothered to check to see whether it matters that the spread in absolute modeled global mean temperature is three times greater than the warming thats taken place since pre-industrial times.
4 "Until climate science is funded independent of desired energy policy outcomes, we can continue to expect climate research results to be heavily biased in the direction of catastrophic outcomes," Spencer wrote.
4 This is one of many points that I had wanted to draw to the attention of the UN's climate panel last year when the technical support unit met in Hawaii (these bureaucrats love their fancy hotels in exotic locations, paid for at your expense and mine) to conduct what was called the "scoping" meeting for the fifth quinquennial climate assessment report of the climate panel, due to be published in 2013. I was invited, and duly registered on line, but the moment the narrow and poisonous faction that controls the scientific input to the panel realized I was coming a very senior scientist prominent as the first named lead author of one of the previous UN climate assessments wrote to me making it very plain, in effect, that anyone who dared to raise difficult questions would not be welcome, and he refused to allow me to attend.
4 As noted, the defects in the IPCC process, and the official expert advisory process more broadly, have gone unacknowledged and unremedied by what I call the environmental policy milieu, and the critics have been largely disregarded. This high-level official failure, as also the defects themselves, are easily accounted for: both have resulted from chronic and pervasive bias.
4 I would have advised the moderator, Jeffrey Mervis, to focus on somewhat different topics, ones that might have made the scientists a bit less comfortable: the blatant corruption of the peer-review process, particularly in climate science; the reality that much of what is published in very prominent peer-reviewed journals simply cannot be replicated; how journal editors mere mortals with biases of their own can be constrained from favoring some findings over others in the publication process; the efforts of some politicians Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is a prominent example to criminalize dissent from climate orthodoxy through the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act statutes.
4 Frankly, the whole process, not just the discredited Dr Pachauri (in shut-eyed denial at a press conference yesterday), needs purging or it will drag down the reputation of science with it. One of the most shocking things for those who champion science, as I do, has been the sight of the science Establishment reacting to each scandal in climate science with indifference or contempt. The contrast with the thorough investigation of the Hauser affair is striking.
4 when we sent our comments to the IPCC AR4, they were mostly rejected.
4 Among the scientific disciplines, the concentrated climate panic is confined to the specialized interdisciplinary clique of self-described "climate scientists", a scholarly discipline that was pretty much created and greatly inflated with the very purpose of spreading the climate hysteria and to make it look "connected to science".
4 The most recent example of the failure of editorial and peer review occurred in a September 2007 article in a U.S. journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The authors claimed to show that pollen from GM corn was injurious to certain insects in a laboratory mock-up of an aquatic ecosystem, but their conclusions are dubious, and their methodology sloppy and inadequately described. More important, the researchers reported elsewhere that they had failed to find these same effects in studies in the field, details they neglected to reveal in the PNAS article. This is a critical omission because laboratory studies are designed to mimic what happens in the real world. In other words, even if the laboratory studies had been performed correctly and carefully, positive results arguably would have been irrelevant because they do not sufficiently mimic what happens in the field.
4 As the extremists lose the argument and become more desperate, that is changing. John Abraham, a lecturer in fluid mechanics at a bible-college in Minnesota has recently issued and widely disseminated a hilariously mendacious 83-minute attempted rebuttal of a speech by me about the climate last October in St. Paul, Minnesota.
4 Does this sneering sentiment represent a strident admission by Oreskes ??? and by extension, her comrades in the real ???denial?? camp ??? that she has no fear of ??? nay, embraces socialism? Is she saying, along with Newsweek Magazine, ???We are all socialists now!??? Does she believe (and hold in disdain the fact) that the American Founders also gained ??? after one of the most thorough, brilliant, and inspired studies in comparative governments and their flaws in ???the course of human events?? ??? a ???paranoid ideological fear?? of the Leviathan State?
4 Lake Level Rise Much Faster Than IPCC Predicted
4 The reason that these professional organizations claim there is a consensus is that the very limited individuals who make these policy statementsdo not permit their membership to vote, or to present alternative viewpoints. The Senators to whom this letter were addressed should reach out for a broader range of inputs with respect to the role of humans in the climate system.
4 Some excellent coverage of the climate change angle to the Queensland floods from Andrew Bolt , including some shameful attempts to exploit the situation by arch-warmist David Karoly. There is a strongly worded rebuttal from another academic, Prof Stewart Franks.
4 P.S. I??ve read the book. Responding to all its disinformation is like getting a root canal without anaesthetic. I??m glad that Brandon Shollenberger has considered some of the points, but, even with the considerable effort that he??s made, he??s only scratched the surface of the disinformation. It amazes me that the climate ???community??, which one presumes as having some residual scientific standards, not only takes no offence at Mann??s disinformation, but even embraces it.
4 Gleicks integrity seems to have nothing to do with scientific integrity, but rather loyalty to and consistency with what I have called the UNFCCC/IPCC ideology .
4 Although it may sound a bit like sour grapes, heres the way that Ive rationalized Natures editorial decision. Ive become convinced that many of the editors of the high impact journals are inclined to cast opinion pieces as salvos in the ongoing war between climate change believers and skeptics. Articles like mine that take issue with the way in which the war is being waged are not particularly welcome. By soliciting opinion pieces and by selecting, from among the growing list of contributed articles, the very few that will be sent out for peer review, the editors promote their vision of what constitutes groundbreaking and policy relevant science. What if it is not the right vision?
4 How would a more politically diverse scientific community improve this situation? First, it could foster greater confidence among Republican politicians about the legitimacy of mainstream science. Second, it would cultivate more informed, creative, and challenging debates about the policy implications of scientific knowledge. This could help keep difficult problems like climate change from getting prematurely straitjacketed by ideology. A more politically diverse scientific community would, overall, support a healthier relationship between science and politics. It should come as no surprise that the increasing politicization of science has come to make science more political rather than politics more scientific. At the same time, the more partisan and/or and ideological that you are, the more welcome and comfortable that you will find the politicization of science, as it reenforces your preconceptions.
4 But I am hoping this essay will promote some self reflection among climate scientists regarding their own ethical conflicts and values. Unfortunately, I suspect this essay will also trigger a backlash from the consensus police (absence of such a backlash would help disprove my thesis ha ha), but I am pretty much immune to all that at this point.
4 Further ?vindication? of the Climategate emailers was to follow, of course, in Muir Russell?s equally probing investigation. To be fair, Russell manages to issue a criticism or two. He says the scientists were sometimes ?misleading??but without meaning to be (a plea which, in the case of the ?trick to hide the decline?, is an insult to one?s intelligence). On the apparent conspiracy to subvert peer review, it found that the ?allegations cannot be upheld??but, as the impressively even-handed Fred Pearce of the Guardian notes, this was partly on the grounds that ?the roles of CRU scientists and others could not be distinguished from those of colleagues. There was ?team responsibility?.? Edward Acton, vice-chancellor of the university which houses CRU, calls this ?exoneration?.
4 The government, backed by their butt buddies at the IPCC are not going to warn us, they are not going to admit that global warming was flawed science at best and an out and out con at the worst.
4 In early June the Daily Caller reported that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists have found a solution to the 15-year pause in global warming: They adjusted the hiatus in warming out of the temperature record. This is what Heartland and others have been fighting against and exposing since the global warming hoax began in the late 1980s. And we are beginning to see the Congress respond.
4 Warm Bias: How The Met Office Mislead The British Public
4 The Clean Development Mechanism delivers the greatest green scam of all
4 This represents politically assisting the IPCC to enable UN, EU, and US bureaucrats and political appointees to avoid official email channels for specific official work of high public interest, performed on official time and using government computers, away from the prying eyes of increasingly skeptical taxpayers.
4 They keep lowering the temperature increases they expect, from 0.30C per decade in 1990, to 0.20C per decade in 2001, and now 0.15C per decade yet they have the gall to tell us its worse than expected. These people are not scientists. They over-estimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide, selectively deny evidence, and now they cheat and lie to conceal the truth.
4 Let's sum up: we now have ironclad proof that a) there is no data proving global warming even exists, b) the IPCC scientists knew that the data didn't support their views and created dummy results to get the answer they wanted, and c) thy used their undeserved respect in the scientific community to suppress any research which contradicted them, regardless of its scientific merit.
4 Lets look at the next station over at Elmira, N.Y. Guess what, exactly the same data tampering they knocked three degrees off the past temperatures and made the cooling trend disappear. The early part of the 20th century was cooled five degrees. What possible error could require five degrees of data tampering?
4 In lockstep with temperature, IPCC scientists needed to show a monotonic increase in CO2 such that the correlation with temperature was apparent at least since 1950/1960.So CO2 records have also been manipulated. One manipulation was the arbitrary changing of the age of the gas trapped in the upper part of an ice core, where the pressure changes were less drastic than in the deeper parts. In the upper part of the core, taken from Siple, Antarctica, the ice was deposited in the year 1890, and the CO2 concentrationin it was 328 ppmv (Friedli et al. 1986, Neftel et al.1985), and not the 290 ppmv needed to prove the man-madewarming hypothesis. The same CO2 concentration of 328ppmv was measured in the air collected directly from the atmosphere at the Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii, 83 years laterin 1973 (Boden et al. 1990). So, it was shockingly clear thatthe pre-industrial level of CO2 was the same as in the second half of the 20th Century.To solve this problem, these researchers simply made an ad hoc assumption: The age of the gas recovered from 1 to 10 grams of ice was arbitrarily decreed to be exactly 83 years younger than the ice in which it was trapped! This was notsupported by any experimental evidence, but only by assumptions which were in conflict with the facts (Jaworowski 1994a,Jaworowski et al. 1992b). The corrected proxy ice data were then smoothly aligned with the direct atmospheric measurements
4 The main impression that I get from the emails is that the various scientists think that I and other requesters are simply doing this to harass them. Nothing could be further from the truth. I respect actual scientists, I??m short of time myself so I understand time pressures, so I have no desire to put any scientist to any extra effort beyond providing what science requires a full accounting of the data, the methods, and in some cases the computer code used to do the research. Anything more is harassment but anything less is scientific obstruction. And if they would provide those things when they publish their results, they??d never hear from me. And if Nature Magazine and Science Magazine and the National Science Foundation and all of the journals and funders would just enforce their own existing rules on archiving and transparency, the problem would be solved. But noooo, for the select friends of Phil these bothersome transparency regulations are ignored and overlooked.
4 But Gavin did a trick. He cooled the baseline temperatures, so that half of the tampering is cooling before 1970, and half is warming after 1970.
4 There is no scientific basis for any of it. None whatsoever. The whole thing has been made up by a tiny handful of malevolent, radicalized scientists highly placed in various Western meteorological organizations. If you want to know who they are, read online the Climategate emails that they exchanged with one another over the past ten years. You will be struck as I was by just how nasty these fraudsters are.
4 Why do climate scientists bother to gather data when the go-to methodology is to manipulate it to prop up the global warming agenda?
4 In CRU??s evidence to Muir Russell, Briffa, with his characteristic inconsistency, contradicted his earlier statement that they had not ???considered?? the possibility of additional data. Not only did he contradict this earlier statement, he stated that the original intention and objective of the Briffa et al 2008 article was to produce an integrated Polar Urals/Yamal series (along the lines that Climate Audit had wondered about), and that this objective was not pursued only because it was felt that this work could not be completed in time:
4 Currently public emails show Mann was unable to provide even his close colleagues data he used in some of his papers and could not remember which data sets he used. A query to UVA shows the university, who owns the data and notebooks resulting from sponsored research, had no copy of Manns logbooks and never gave him permission to take them with him when he left UVA. The university refused to inquire within Manns department as to whether anyone there knew whether he even kept a research logbook, so its impossible for me to know whether he stole the logbook or just never prepared one in the first place.
4 According to recently disclosed e-mails from a National Academies of Science listserv, prominent climate scientists affiliated with the U.S. National Academies of Science have been planning a public campaign to paper over the damaged reputation of global warming alarmism. Their scheme would involve officials at the National Academies and other professional associations producing studies to endorse the researchers pre-existing assumptions and create confusion about the revelations of the rapidly expanding Climategate scandal.
4 Mann, Wahl, Ammann, Ritson, Ramsdorff are all dining out on the fact that von Storch et al 2004 did not implement a detrending step in their implementation of MBH98. (Although given that Mann would not be "intimidated" into releasing his algorithm and cited Zorita et al 2003 to us as evidence that people could implement his algorithm, they should be embarrassed that people still could misinterpret their methodology. )
4 Warmists were on a treadmill defending the hypothesis. Over 6000 leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) delineate the challenges and political rather than scientific responses. It required three major activities. A steady flow of material that appeared to provide proof; rejection of evidence that contradicted the hypothesis; and efforts to silence critics and control research and publications.
4 The investigation into the alleged global warming data fraud by Virginia's Attorney General may soon have a whole new angle. This comes from a previously overlooked connection between discredited tree-ring proxy researcher, Michael Mann and Yale's now deceased climate professor, Barry Saltzman.
4 Andrew Bolt, an inconvenient Aussie, details some of the more egregious emails and finds so-called leading scientific minds colluding to ruin the careers of those that disagree:
4 My view was that it was a conspiracy right from the start to bamboozle the world on the lie of anthropogenic global warming sandbagging much of the mainstream media, the markets and the educational system to not believe their own eyes and ears.
4 Maddow also looks at the Climategate inquiries, quoting Russell's conclusions that the CRU scientists are beyond reproach, but strangely not mentioning the fact his contradictory finding that hiding the decline was "misleading".
4 Im glad its getting old Gavin, very very happy in fact. Yet there is a simple truth, Gavin (who is a scientist) doesnt know which data was used anymore than we do. BECAUSE CRU WONT RELEASE IT! Why doesnt he want to know? His colleagues at CRU (Climategate central headquarters) have recently been shown hiding data from reconstructions, blocking skeptical papers which demonstrate the problems in paleo math, and removing points from temperature curves to hide downtrends. We know that only a single very high warming station is being used in GHCN for the Antarctic. We know that Switzerland and Austrailia have some very unusual warming trends. We know his colleagues blocked in two cases, papers critical of the Siberian data. Even assuming that they didnt succumb to the pressures of fraudulent selection in Russia, how is Gavin so sure his colleagues havent made an honest error.
4 My cue for those pieces was the evidence multiplying from across the world that something very odd has been going on with those official surface temperature records, all of which ultimately rely on data compiled by NOAAs GHCN. Careful analysts have come up with hundreds of examples of how the original data recorded by 3,000-odd weather stations has been adjusted, to exaggerate the degree to which the Earth has actually been warming. Figures from earlier decades have repeatedly been adjusted downwards and more recent data adjusted upwards, to show the Earth having warmed much more dramatically than the original data justified.
4 Guest essay by Professor Philip Lloyd People have the nasty habit of giving their opponents names. Those who are convinced that humans are wrecking the world by burning fossil fuels call those who dont believe them denialists. It implies that they are close to the Holocaust deniers, and so are clearly beyond the pale. I have come to the conclusion that they are wrong. The true denialists are those who believe in global warming, and who will go to any lengths to deny the evidence against that position. For instance, the final draft of the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCCs Working Group 1 concerns itself with observations of the climate and how it might change in future. Within minutes of it being released, skeptics had noted that a key figure, which compared predicted temperatures to measurements, had been drastically altered after the second draft had been approved.
4 Science is vitally important for the operation of highly technological society, and that science must be open, transparent, and must adhere to the scientific method. The institution of science has no place in it for hiding data, hiding data-processing, shaping data to conform to pre-existing beliefs, undermining the peer-review process, cherry-picking reports in order to slant political IPCC reports, or slandering critics by comparing them with flat-earthers, moon-landing conspiracy theorists, or holocaust deniers. Let the Climategate hearings begin.
4 "Many would place the beginning of the global warming hoax on the Senate testimony delivered by James Hansen of NASA during the summer of 1988. More than anything else, this exhibition of hyped alarm triggered my active skepticism about the man-made global warming scare. This skepticism was amplified when I acted as reviewer of the first three IPCC reports, in 1990, 1996, and 2001. Increasingly claims were made for which there was no evidence; in some cases the "evidence' was clearly manufactured. For example, the 1966 report used selective data and doctored graphs. It also featured changes in the text that were made after the scientists had approved it and before it was printed."
4 It will likely be open season on Mann. Anyone may now freely dismiss him in the harshest terms as a junk scientist who shilled for a failed global warming cabal. Without fear of his civil legal redress, we may now refer to Mann for what he is: a climate criminal, a fraudster.
4 Climate fraudsters now claim that there never was a Medieval Warm Period, because they are paid to lie about the climate in support of the White House politicalagenda.
4 Climate skeptics are having a field day, celebrating the firestorm of controversy surrounding the UK's Hadley Center Climate Research Unit (CRU), until recently, the world's leading climate research center. One skeptic, a Canadian named Steve McIntyre has particular cause for doing a happy dance over the misery of the CRU.
4 I predicted a few days ago that NCDC data tampering would wipe out New Yorks coldest year, and make it only second coldest. My prediction was spot on. They massively cooled the past to wreck this years record.
4 The climate change industry, along with people like Al Gore have slammed skeptics for not publishing in the peer reviewed literature. What the Climategate documents reveal is that this small group of scientists, who often peer-review each other's work as well as skeptical articles, have discussed ways of keeping findings they don't like out of the peer-reviewed literature as well as the IPCC reports, even if it required trying to oust editors, boycotting certain journals, or to reclassifying a prestigious journal that publishes skeptical articles as a fringe journal unworthy of consideration. They also discuss their specific intention to exclude contrary findings from the IPCC reports, even if they "have to redefine what the peer-reviewed literature is!"
4 Grafting instrumental data onto proxy data to produce a seemingly continuous record is trickery, because instrumental data, unlike proxy data, are massively influenced by land-use changes and site-specific quality control issues.
4 Bloggers and skeptics immediately tore into the package, and found evidence suggesting that CRU scientists exaggerated warming; worked furiously to hide their data from outside examination; may have conspired to actually delete information to avoid freedom of information requests, and may have conspired to keep contrary findings from being published in respected climate journals, and IPCC reports.
4 GISS shows 0.3C of warming in the US since 1930, which is 100% due to data tampering.
4 The flagrant liars at the University of Colorado and NASA claim that sea level is rising 3.3 mm/year
4 ost troubling, are the suggestions that a tribe of incestuous climate scientists may have actively conspired to undermine the peer-review process.
4 All three examinations took place within the country of physical jurisdiction, Great Britain, and none disappointed those of us anticipating whitewash. Simply stated, all parties were cleared of all wrongdoing other than perhaps sloppy journaling and sophomoric note-passing and all suspensions were lifted. As Andrew Montford summarized in his report , The Climategate Inquiries:
4 none of the Climategate panels mounted an inquiry that was comprehensive within their area of remit
4 Emails Reveal AGs Colluding with Green Groups to Investigate Climate Skeptics
4 Even before the Climategate Emails came to light, the problem posed by the Medieval Warm Period to this band was known. "We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period" read a pre-Climategate email, circa 1995, as attested to at hearings of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works. But the Climategate transcripts were more extensive and more illuminating they provided an unvarnished look at the struggles that the climate practitioners underwent before settling on their scientific dogma.
4 In the interest of full disclosure, I have been an unpaid policy advisor to The Heartland Institute for many years, only once receiving a small grant many years ago to help fund research involving the global warming hoax. These days donations to my blog help sustain the effort.
4 As readers no doubt know, I have previously obtained a great deal of Sir John Beddington??s correspondence around the Climategate affair. As evidence of Sir John??s involvement in setting up the whitewashes grows, I started to wonder about the information that Sir John??s office had said they had withheld for one reason or another. In particular I wondered what was covered by this:
